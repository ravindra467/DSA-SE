b'Problem\nYou are given a tree with NNN vertices rooted at vertex 111, where ithithith vertex having a value AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b.\nYou are also given QQQ queries where each query gives you a node uuu and a value valvalval. You need to add valvalval to each node vvv such that vvv is in the subtree of uuu\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain NNN and QQQ, number of nodes and queries respectively.\nSecond line contains NNN space separated integers, the initial value of each node.\nNext N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contain two integers uuu and vvv representing an edge between nodes uuu and vvv.\nThe next QQQ lines contain two integers each uuu and valvalval as explained in the problem statement.\n\nOutput:\nOutput a single like containing NNN space separated integers where the ithithith integer denotes the value of the ithithith node after all queries have been executed.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa45\xc3\x971051 \\leq N, Q \\leq 5 \\times 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa45\xc3\x97105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,val\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq Ai, val \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,val\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq u \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4u\xe2\x89\xa4N\n\nSubtasks\n\n20 points : 1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq N, Q \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa41000\n80 points : Original constraints\n\nSample Input:\n 5 3\n 1 1 1 1 1\n 1 2\n 1 3\n 3 4\n 3 5\n 1 1\n 2 3\n 3 2\n\nSample Output:\n 2 5 4 4 4\n\nExplanation\n\nEach node has an initial value of 1. The first query adds 1 to each node(since all nodes are in the subtree of node 1). Second query adds 3 to all nodes in subtree of node 2 and node 2 is a leaf so, it itself is the only node in its subtree. Third query adds 2 to all nodes in the subtree of node 3, namely nodes 3, 4 and 5.'
