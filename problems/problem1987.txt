b'Problem\nRussell for his next IPL match invited his relatives. Now Russell is interested to play a game with his Nephew taking a problem of tree resembling IPL match hierarchy . So he describes the problem like,\nIn the tree with  N leaves and N\xe2\x88\x921 edges , where the leaves denoting match points gained previously varies from 0 to any natural number of some particular i-th team and there are N-1 pairs of leaves {ai , bi} between which there is an edge. Edge I connects leaves ai and bi . Each team in the tree has a previous point written on its leaf . Let ci be the value written on leaf i (basically team i) . Nephew will be given Q queries . The i-th query, consisting of integers qi, ei, and xi, is as follows :\n\nIf qi=1: for each leaf v reachable from leaf aei without visiting leaf bei by traversing edges, replace cv with cv+xi.\nIf qi=2: for each leaf v reachable from leaf bei without visiting leaf aei by traversing edges , replace cv with cv+xi.\nAfter processing all queries , print total new points of each team written on each leaf .\n\nConstraints:\n\nAll values in input are integers.\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 2\xc3\x9710^5\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 ai,bi \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xe2\x89\xa4 2\xc3\x9710^5\nti \xe2\x88\x88 {1,2}\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 ei \xe2\x89\xa4 N\xe2\x88\x921\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 xi \xe2\x89\xa4 10^9\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 ci \xe2\x89\xa4 10^9\n\nInput Format:\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nc1 c2 ... cN\na1  b1\n.\n.\n.\naN\xe2\x88\x921  bN\xe2\x88\x921\nQ\nt1  e1  x1\n\xe2\x8b\xae\ntQ  eQ  xQ\nOuput Format:\nPrint the values c1 , c2 , \xe2\x80\xa6 , cN after processing all queries, each in its own line.\nSample Input1:\n5\n0 0 0 0 0\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n4 5\n4\n1 1 1\n1 4 10\n2 1 100\n2 2 1000\nSample Output1:\n11\n110\n1110\n110\n100\nSample Input2:\n7\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n2 1\n2 3\n4 2\n4 5\n6 1\n3 7\n7\n2 2 1\n1 3 2\n2 2 4\n1 6 8\n1 3 16\n2 4 32\n2 1 64\nSample Output2:\n73\n10\n16\n30\n63\n78\n12'
