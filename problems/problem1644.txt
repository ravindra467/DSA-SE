b'Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.\nProblem description\nYou will be given a zero-indexed array A. You need to rearrange its elements in such a way that the following conditions are satisfied:\nA[i] \xe2\x89\xa4 A[i+1] if i is even.\nA[i] \xe2\x89\xa5 A[i+1] if i is odd.\nIn other words the following inequality should hold: A[0] \xe2\x89\xa4 A[1] \xe2\x89\xa5 A[2] \xe2\x89\xa4 A[3] \xe2\x89\xa5 A[4], and so on. Operations \xe2\x89\xa4 and \xe2\x89\xa5 should alter.\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer N, that is the size of the array A. The second line of each test case contains the elements of array A\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing N space separated integers, which are the elements of A arranged in the required order. If there are more than one valid arrangements, you can output any of them.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\nSum of N in one test file \xe2\x89\xa4 600000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 A[i] \xe2\x89\xa4 10^9\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n2\n3 2\n3\n10 5 22 3\n2 10 5\nExplanation:\nExample case 1.A[0] ? A[1] is satisfied, 2 ? 3.Example case 2.A[0] ? A[1] is satisfied, 2 ? 10.A[1] ? A[2] is satisfied, 10 ? 5.Note: 5 10 2 is also valid answer.'
