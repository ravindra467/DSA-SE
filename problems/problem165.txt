b"Problem\nShaun was given NNN pairs of parenthesis ( )  by his teacher who gave him a difficult task.The task consists of two steps. First,Shaun should colour all NNN pairs of parenthesis each with different color but opening and closing bracket of a particular pair should be of same colour. Then,Shaun should report to his teacher the number of ways he can arrange all 2\xe2\x88\x97N2*N2\xe2\x88\x97N brackets such that sequence form is valid. Teacher defined valid sequence by these rules:\n\nAny left parenthesis '(' must have a corresponding right parenthesis ')'.\nAny right parenthesis ')' must have a corresponding left parenthesis '('.\nLeft parenthesis '(' must go before the corresponding right parenthesis ')'.\n\nNote: Shaun could match opening and closing brackets of different colours.\nSince number of ways can be large, Shaun would report the answer as modulo 1000000007 (109+710^9 + 7109+7).\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nEach testcase contains of a single line of input, one integer NNN.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line answer given by Shaun to his teacher modulo 1000000007.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000001 \\leq T \\leq 1000001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000001 \\leq N \\leq 1000001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100000\n\nSample Input:\n   3\r\n   1\r\n   2\r\n   3\n\nSample Output:\n   1\r\n   6\r\n   90\n\nEXPLANATION:\nHere numbers from 111 to NNN have been used to denote parenthesis.A unique number corresponds to a unique pair of parenthesis.\n-In the first test case , you can use only one color to color the parenthesis  you could arrange it only in one way i.e, 1 1\n-In the second test case  you can use two colors and the possible ways of arranging it are\n1 1 2 2\n1 2 2 1\n1 2 1 2\n2 2 1 1\n2 1 1 2\n2 1 2 1"
