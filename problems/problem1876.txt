And they want to travel in such a way so that they spend least time in travelling. They starts travelling from hotel and you are supposed to find out minimum time such that they visit every place. The places in a city are connected by bidirectional road and there is unique path between any pair of place. They can travel through road any number of time such that they must have to visit all place in minimum possible time.\nYou will be given N places with the road and travelling time among places. The couple start from hotel which is situated at place 1.\n\nInput\n\nFirst line contains T, the number of test cases.\nEach test case consists of one integer N, number of places in city.\nEach next N-1 lines consist of three integers U,V and W denotes there is road between U and V. W is the time to travel from U to V or vice-versa. \n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the minimum time require to visit all the places in city.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 <= T <= 10\n1 <= N <= 20000\n1 <= U,V <= N\n1 <= W <= 10^9\n\nExample\nInput:\n1\n6\n1 2 1\n1 3 4\n2 5 2\n2 6 50\n1 4 5\nOutput:\n73\n\nExplanation\n\nFollowing is the travelling path of couple:\n1->4->1->3->1->2->5->2->6\n'
