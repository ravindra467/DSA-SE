b"Problem\nTeacher Sungjae wanted to hold a programming competition for his students where every participant need to be included into  team. The participants submitted their team names before the deadline. After the competition ran for half an hour, (It is assured that each registered team will submit absolutely once within half an hour) Sungjae mistakenly pressed a button that changed the order of the registered team names. Now in the submission list, order of the characters in the team's name doesn't matter. That means abcabcabc, acbacbacb, bacbacbac, bcabcabca, cabcabcab, cbacbacba refers to the same team. The competition ran for two hours and then ended. Sungjae now counting each of the team's score and wants to print the registered team names and score. The scoreboard should be ordered based on scores in decreasing order and if two teams have same score, Sangjae would follow lexicographical order.\nNNN.BBB. frequency of each character's in a registered team's name will not match with another team.\nThat means two teams named xoxoxoxoxoxo and oxoxoxoxoxox is not possible. Because both of them have the same frequency of each of the characters (two 'o' and two 'x'). Similarly abbabbabb and babbabbab is not possible (because both of them have one 'a' and two 'b').\nIt is ensured that only possible test cases will be given.\nInput:\n\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers , NNN and RRR - total number of submissions and the number of submissions within first half an hour.\n\n\nThen RRR  lines follow: the i'th line contains a string tititi, registered names of the teams and an integer pipipi, points they got on that submission.\n\n\nThen N\xe2\x88\x92RN-RN\xe2\x88\x92R  lines follow: the i-th line contains a string tititi- the i-th team's name (in any order) in lowercase letter only and pipipi -points they got on that submission.\n\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase,print the scoreboard.\nThat means print the teams name and their point according to their score in decreasing order and if some of them have same score,print the teams name in lexicographical order\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq T \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq R \\leq N \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ti\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq ti \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4ti\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\leq pi \\leq 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa4106\n\nSum of points (pipipi) of a team will not cross 10910^9109.\nSample Input:\n1\n10 5\namigoes  1\nbannermen 1\nmonarchy 4\noutliers 5\niniciador 10\naegimos 2\niiiacdnor 1\neilorstu 1\ngimosae 3\nmnachroy 7\n\nSample Output:\niniciador 11\nmonarchy 11\namigoes 6\noutliers 6\nbannermen 1\n\nExplanation:\n\nItItIt isisis assuredassuredassured thatthatthat eacheacheach teamteamteam willwillwill submitsubmitsubmit onceonceonce withinwithinwithin firstfirstfirst halfhalfhalf ananan hourhourhour.That means -\n\nthat kind of submissions isn't possible within first half an hour.\nDataset can be huge.
