b"Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.\nRecently, Max has visited the place where the Wild Things are again. He was very happy to know, that the monsters are living in peace now.\nHis friend Carol was so excited about Max's coming back, that he proposed everyone a brand new game. Unfortunately, all the Wild Things refused to play the game, except Max and K.W., so there were only three players playing the game.\n\nThe area, where the game takes place, is the Cartesian plane(link).\nThere are N interesting points on the plane.  Each interesting point has integer coordinates. Also, all the interesting points form a strictly convex polygon(link). \nThere is no need to explain the rules of the game, but it's quite important to mention the preparation process:\nIn order to play the game, the players(Max, K.W. and Carol) must choose three different interesting points\nand plant  themselves there. Also, they must choose some positive integer S.\n\nLet's assume, that Max's interesting point is A, K.W.'s - B and Carol's - C.\nIf the area of triangle ABC is greater than or equal to S, then the game will be awesome.\n Otherwise, it will be awful.\n\n\nNow Max is on his way home. His head is filled up with the memories about the wonderful game he used to play with\nhis friends. But there's the thing, that annoys him: he remembers, that he played the game Q times, but\nhe can't recall any interesting point chosen by him!\n\n\nMax exactly remembers, that in the beginning of i'th game K.W. chose point B = Bi,\nCarol chose point C = Ci and S was equal to Si.\nAlso, he remembers, that all the games were awesome.\nSo, you are to calculate the number of different interesting points,\nthat could be chosen by Max as A in the beginning of i'th game. This number can be equal to zero(in that case we can conclude, that i'th game wasn't awesome - anyway, just output zero).\n\nInput\nThe first line of a test case contains two integers N and Q,\ndenoting the number of the interesting points and the number of times Max played the game.\nThe next N lines contain two integers Xi and Yi each, denoting coordinates of i'th interesting point. The points are 1-indexed.\nThe next Q lines contain three integers Bi, Ci and Si each. In the beginning of i'th game K.W. chose point Bi'th interesting point, Carol chose Ci'th interesting point and S was equal to Si.\nIt's guaranteed, that the interesting points form a strictly convex polygon and are given in clockwise or counterclockwise order.\nIt's also guaranteed, that there are no three vertices in the input that lie on one line and no point is given twice.\nOutput\nFor each round of the game, output a single line containing the number of different interesting points, that could be chosen by Max as A in the beginning of the corresponding game.\nConstraints\n3 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 60000;\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xe2\x89\xa4 250000;\n|X|, |Y| \xe2\x89\xa4 108, for each interesting point;\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 B  != C \xe2\x89\xa4 N, S \xe2\x89\xa4 1018, for each game.\nExample\nInput:\n4 2\n0 0\n4 0\n7 3\n7 7\n1 4 1\n1 4 100\nOutput:\n2\n0\nExplanations\n\nFor the first query, A could be equal to both 2 and 3;\nFor the second query, there are no possible variants for A.\n"
