Each chef can, alone, give birth to many younger chefs, which can then give birth to even younger chefs, and so on. It is easy to see that the family structure of any chef (formed by this chef's direct and indirect descendants) is a tree.\nA family is a tree such that its root does not have a parent, i.e. it is not a proper subtree of any tree. In a valid family tree, the age of each chef that has a parent is strictly smaller than the age of this chef's parent. The respect of a family is the age of the oldest chef in this family. The respect of Chefland is the sum of respects of all families in Chefland.\nA long time ago, there were several families in Chefland. All their data was stored in the Cookbook; the families were represented by listing all the (undirected) edges in all family trees and the ages of all chefs. Since all family trees were valid, it was always possible to deduce the exact parent-child relations.\nOver many years, the book got contaminated \xe2\x80\x94 people added some extra edges (possibly zero) between some chefs. Currently, there are NNN chefs in the book (numbered 111 through NNN; note that no chefs were added) and MMM undirected edges between them.\nYoung Chef is now wondering: what could the respect of Chefland have been, as originally described in the Cookbook? Consider all ways to remove a (possibly empty) set of edges such that the resulting graph contains only valid families. For each possible kkk, find the sum of respects of Chefland over all the ways such that the resulting graph contains exactly kkk families. Since these numbers may be large, compute them modulo 109+710^9 + 7109+7.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and MMM.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b, where AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b denotes the age of the iii-th chef.\nEach of the next MMM lines contains two space-separated integers UUU and VVV denoting an edge in the Cookbook between chefs UUU and VVV.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing NNN space-separated integers. For each valid kkk, the kkk-th of these integers should denote the sum of respects over all the ways to remove edges such that the number of families is exactly kkk, modulo 109+710^9+7109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4501 \\le T \\le 501\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa450\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45,0002 \\le N \\le 5,0002\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851051 \\le M \\le 5 \\cdot 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\le A_i \\le 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid iii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4U,V\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le U, V \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4U,V\xe2\x89\xa4N\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 5,0005,0005,000\nthe sum of MMM over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x851055 \\cdot 10^55\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe graph described on the input does not contain any self-loops or multiple edges\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points):\n\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 505050\nthe sum of MMM over all test cases does not exceed 181818\n\nSubtask #2 (20 points): the graph described on the input is a valid family\nSubtask #3 (70 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n2 1\n1 2\n1 2\n3 2\n3 2 4\n1 2\n2 32 3\n0 14 9\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: There is one way to have exactly 111 family and the respect of that family must be 222.\nThere is one way to have exactly 222 families. These families must have respects 111 and 222, so the respect of Chefland for 222 families must be 1+2=31 + 2 = 31+2=3.\nExample case 2: There is no way to have exactly 111 family.\nThere are two ways to have 222 families, with respects 333 and 444 (the same for both ways). Therefore, the answer for 222 families is 2\xe2\x8b\x85(3+4)=142 \\cdot (3 + 4) = 142\xe2\x8b\x85(3+4)=14.\nThere is only one way to have 333 families, with respects 333, 222 and 444. Therefore, the respect of Chefland for 333 families must be 3+2+4=93 + 2 + 4 = 93+2+4=9."
