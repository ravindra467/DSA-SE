b'Problem\nGotham City is the home of Batman, and Batman likes to keep his people together.\nThere are NNN houses in the city. The resident of the ithi^{th}ith house is of type AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b. It is known that people of the same type are friends and people of different types are not friends.\nTo maintain peace, Batman can do the following type of operation:\n\nChoose indices iii and jjj (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4N)(1\\leq i \\le j \\le N)(1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4N) and reverse the substring A[i,j]A[i,j]A[i,j].\n\nDetermine the length of the longest range of friends after applying at most kkk operations on the string for all 0\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4N0 \\le k \\le N0\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4N.\nInput Format\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN, the number of houses in Gotham city.\nThe next line contains a string AAA with NNN characters. The ithi^{th}ith character denotes the type of the ithi^{th}ith person.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output a single line, (N+1)(N+1)(N+1) space-separated integers where the ithi^{th}ith integer signifies the length of the longest range of friends after applying  at most iii operations.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq T \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051\\le N \\le 2\\cdot 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\nSum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\\cdot 10^52\xe2\x8b\x85105.\nString AAA contains lowercase English alphabets only.\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n4\naaaa\n4\nabca\n7\nbabbaab\n4 4 4 4 4\n1 2 2 2 2\n2 3 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\nExplanation:\nTest case 111: All 444 people are friends. Thus, the answer is 444 for all values of kkk.\nTest case 222:\n\nFor k=0k=0k=0, the length of the longest range of friends is 111.\nFor k=1k=1k=1, we can choose i=1i=1i=1 and j=3j=3j=3. On reversing the substring [1,3][1,3][1,3], we get cbaa. Thus, length of longest range of friends is 222.\nFor k=2,3,k=2,3,k=2,3, and 444, the length of the longest range of friends is 222 as no more people of the same type can be grouped together.\n'
