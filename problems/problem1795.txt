b'Problem\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is our choices that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHarry Potter was sitting in library staring at newly found Tom Riddle\'s secret diary. Out of curiosity, he started asking questions about the past of Chambers Of Secrets. Tom took him to the year of 1942. There Harry saw, Dumbledore and McGonagall arranging the students to stop Hagrid from opening Chamber Of Secrets. To stop Hagrid, the students need to be arranged in particular order of their heights.\nSuppose there are NNN students each with height hih_ihi\xe2\x80\x8b standing in line. The order of the students must be as follows:\n\nIf the number of students is less than 333, it is always possible to\narrange students.\nhih_ihi\xe2\x80\x8b  =  hi\xe2\x88\x921h_{i-1}hi\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x80\x8b  +  GCD( hi\xe2\x88\x922h_{i-2}hi\xe2\x88\x922\xe2\x80\x8b , hi\xe2\x88\x921h_{i-1}hi\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x80\x8b) for all i>2i>2i>2, where GCD(x ,y) is greatest common factor of x and y.\n\nDumbledore asks the then prefect Tom Riddle to arrange the students in the following order. Furthermore, Hagrid being a half-giant, the arrangement of the height of students must be lexicographically\ngreatest.\nThough we know it wasn\'t Hagrid who opened the Chamber Of Secrets but still you need to help Tom and Dumbledore to arrange the students.\nNOTE:NOTE :NOTE: Consider GCD(0,x) = x where x is a non-negative integer.\nInput:\n\nThe first line will contain TTT, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN\nIn the next line, NNN numbers  follow, denoting the height of the students whom you have to arrange\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, print a single line containing NNN numbers separated by space, which denotes the height of the students and follows the conditions given or "\xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921" if the students cannot be arranged following the given condition.  ### Constraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq T \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x971051 \\leq N \\leq 2*10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x97105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41090 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^90\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\nsum of NNN over all test cases is less than 4\xe2\x88\x971064*10^64\xe2\x88\x97106.\n\nSample Input :\n2\n5\n4 6 2 5 3\n3\n3 8 5\nSample Output:\n2 3 4 5 6\n-1'
