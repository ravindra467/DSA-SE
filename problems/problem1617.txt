b'Problem\nThis is a simple cakewalk problem.In this problem you have to print shortest path from one point to another.\n Input:\n- First line of the input contains an integer N denoting the number of groups. Description of N groups follows.\n- Next N lines will consist of a single line containing maximum M space separated integers I.\n- Last line of input will contain 2 space separated integers A and B.\nOutput: - Output is a single line containing space separated integers showing shortest path to reach from A to B. - If there is no path then print None.\nConstraints: 1 <= N <= 10 2 <= M <= 10 0 <= I, A, B <= 100\nExample:\nInput:\n6\t\t\t\n1 2\t\t\t\n3 4\t\t\t\n2 3 6\t\t\n3 6\t\t\t\n7 6\t\t\t\n7 8 9\t\t\n1 8\t\t\t\n\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput: 1 2 6 7 8\nExplanation: - In above example, we have to find the shortest path between 1 and 8 - 1 and 2 are in the same group - 2 and 6 are in the same group - 6 and 7 are in the same group - 7 and 8 are in the same group - Hence shortest path becomes 1 2 6 7 8\nNote: There are many possible paths from 1 to 8, but since we have to find the shortest one, we considered this path.'
