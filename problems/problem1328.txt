b'Problem\n\xc2\xa0\nWe all know electron(the smallest negatively charged particle) and its properties. One of its important property is that they repel each other. These particle are quite familiar among quantum scientists. One such scientist Dr. Rakesh Yadav need to place E electrons in a magnetic field for his experiment. After a long painstaking calculation he found N feasible coordinates along the x-axis. But to minimize the repelling force among electrons he wants to place the electrons, such that the minimum distance between any two of them is as large as possible. This is again a vast calculation. So he wants you to help him find the largest minimum distance.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\nThe first lint contains T,the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test cases contains two space separated integers, N and E.\nThe subsequent line contain N space separated integers x1,x2,x3....denoting feasible position\n\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\nFor each test case output one integer: the largest minimum distance\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T\xe2\x89\xa4 100,000 \n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N\xe2\x89\xa4 100,000 \n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 E\xe2\x89\xa4 N \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 xi\xe2\x89\xa4 1,000,000,000\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n1\n5 3\n1 2 8 4 9\nOutput:\n3\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nExample case 1.\n\nWe can put electrons in position 1,4,8 resulting in minimum distance 3\n\n'
