b"Problem\nRead problems statements Bengali , Mandarin chinese and Vietnamese as well.\nIn Chefland, there are NNN cities (numbered 111 through NNN) connected by N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 bidirectional roads in such a way that it is possible to reach any city from any other city. Each city has its own traditional dish for which it is famous; let's denote the tastiness of the dish in city iii by AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b.\nChef is currently learning how to prepare tastier dishes. At any point, he can only remember how to cook one dish. Initially, the tastiness of the dish he can cook is WWW. Chef is going to travel from city 111 to city vvv. In each city he visits (including 111 and vvv), if the tastiness of the traditional dish of this city is strictly greater than the tastiness of the dish he can currently cook, then he forgets the dish he can currently cook and learns the traditional dish of this city.\nNow, Chef is wondering how many times he is going to learn a new dish during his trip. You should answer QQQ independent queries. In each query, you are given the initial tastiness WWW and Chef's final destination vvv; compute the number of times Chef learns a new dish. Note that the input is given in a special format, so you have to answer the queries online.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer NNN.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\dots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b.\nThe third line contains N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 space-separated integers P2,P3,\xe2\x80\xa6,PNP_2, P_3, \\dots, P_NP2\xe2\x80\x8b,P3\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,PN\xe2\x80\x8b, meaning there's an edge between iii and PiP_iPi\xe2\x80\x8b.\nThe fourth line contains one integer QQQ.\nEach of the following QQQ lines contains two space-separated integers AAA and BBB describing a query in the following format:\n\nLet's denote the answer to the previous query by PrPrPr (Pr=0Pr=0Pr=0 if this is the first query).\nFor this query, v=A\xe2\x8a\x95Prv = A \\oplus Prv=A\xe2\x8a\x95Pr and W=B\xe2\x8a\x95PrW = B \\oplus PrW=B\xe2\x8a\x95Pr.\n\n\n\nOutput\nFor each query, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of times Chef learns a new dish.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\le T \\le 10001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41062 \\le N \\le 10^62\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\le Q \\le 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41081 \\le A_i \\le 10^81\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4108 for each valid iii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x88\x9211 \\le P_i \\le i-11\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x88\x921 for each valid iii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4W\xe2\x89\xa41081 \\le W \\le 10^81\xe2\x89\xa4W\xe2\x89\xa4108\n1\xe2\x89\xa4v\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le v \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4v\xe2\x89\xa4N\nthe sum of NNN for all test cases does not exceed 10610^6106\nthe sum of QQQ for all test cases does not exceed 10610^6106\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n5\n2 3 1 4 5\n1 2 2 3\n2\n2 1\n1 02\n1"
