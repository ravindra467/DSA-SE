b'Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nLet us define the palindromeness of a string in the following way:\n\n\nIf the string is not a palindrome, its\' palindromeness is zero.\nThe palindromeness of an one-letter string is 1.\nThe palindromness of a string S of the length greater than one is 1 + "palindromeness of the string that is formed by the first [|S|/2] symbols of S".\n\n\nLet us consider some examples for better understanding:\n\n\nThe palindromeness of the string zxqfd is 0, since the string is not a palindrome.\nThe palindromeness of the string a is 1, by definition.\nThe palindromeness of the string aa is 2, beucase for "aa" we get 1 + palindromeness of "a", that is one, so we get 2.\nThe palindromeness of the string abacaba is 3.\n\n\nYou are given a string S. Find the sum of the palindromenesses of all the non empty substrings of  S (i.e. S[i..j], where i <= j). In other words, you have to calculate the sum of palindromenesses of N * (N + 1) / 2 substrings of S, where N is the length of S.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of every test case contains a single string S for the corresponding test case.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the answer to the problem.\nConstraints\n\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 3\nS consists only of lower-case Latin letters.\n\n\nSubtask 1 (15 points):\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 |S| \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n\n\nSubtask 2 (23 points):\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 |S| \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n\n\nSubtask 3 (62 points):\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 |S| \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\nzxqfd\naba5\n5\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: There is no palindrome that occurs as the substring of zxqfd and has the length more than 1. The individual characters are palindromes of the palindromeness of 1.\nExample case 2: The palindromeness of aba is 2 and the sum of the palindromenesses of single characters is 3.'
