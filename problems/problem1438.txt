b"Problem\nYou are given a tree. If we select 2 distinct nodes uniformly at random, what's the probability that the distance between these 2 nodes is a prime number?\nInput Format\nThe first line contains a number N: the number of nodes in this tree.\nThe following N-1 lines contain pairs a[i] and b[i], which means there is an edge with length 1 between a[i] and b[i].\nOutput Format\nOutput a real number denote the probability we want.\nYou'll get accept if the difference between your answer and standard answer is no more than 10^-6.\nConstraints\n\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 50,000\nThe input must be a tree.\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput5\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 50.5\nExplanation:\nWe have C(5, 2) = 10 choices, and these 5 of them have a prime distance:\n1-3, 2-4, 3-5: 2\n1-4, 2-5: 3\nNote that 1 is not a prime number."
