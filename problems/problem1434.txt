b"Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nBearland consists of N cities, numbered 1 through N.\nCities are connected with bidirectional roads.\nCities 1 through K were built a long time ago, when citizens liked order and regularity.\nEach pair of those old cities is connected with a road of length X.\nNote that this description generates K*(K-1)/2 roads.\nThere are M newer roads, not necessarily of the same lengths.\nThe i-th of them connects cities ai and bi and has length ci.\nThere is no road that connects a city to itself.\nAll M+K*(K-1)/2 roads are distinct (ie. no two of them connects the same pair of cities).\nIt's guaranteed that it's possible to get from every city to every other city, using one or more roads.\nLimak, a bear, lives in the city S.\nIn order to plan a trip to some other city, for every city he wants to know how quickly he can get there.\nCan you help him and find the distance from S to every city?\nThe distance between two cities is the minimum total length of a path (sequence of roads) between the two cities.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains five integers N, K, X, M and S, denoting the number of cities, the number of old cities, the length of a road between every two old cities, the number of newer roads, and the city where Limak lives, respectively.\n\nEach of the following M lines contains three integers ai, bi and ci, denoting a road of length ci between cities ai and bi.\nAs guaranteed above: no two cities are connected with more than one road, no road connects a city to itself, and it's possible to get from every city to every other city.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing N integers.\nThe i-th of them should denote the distance from the city S to the city i.\nThe distance from S to S is simply 0.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 3\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 S, ai, bi \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 X, ci \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 (45 points): 2 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 500\nSubtask #2 (55 points): Original constraints.\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n5 4 100 2 3\n1 5 50\n5 3 160\n5 4 100 2 3\n1 5 50\n5 3 140\n8 3 15 7 5\n3 4 10\n4 5 20\n5 6 10\n6 1 7\n3 7 1000\n7 8 50\n3 5 1000000000100 100 0 100 150 \n100 100 0 100 140 \n17 32 30 20 0 10 1030 1080\nExplanation:\nTest case 1. There are N = 5 cities. The first K = 4 of them are all connected with each other with roads of length X = 100. There are M = 2 extra roads:\n\nCities 1 and 5 are connected with a road of length 50.\nCities 5 and 3 are connected with a road of length 160.\n\nWe are asked to compute distances to all cities from the city S = 3.\nNote that the distance from a city to itself is 0, and this is why the third number in the ouput is 0."
