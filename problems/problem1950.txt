b'Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.\n\n\tThe following graph G is called a Petersen graph and its vertices have been numbered from 0 to 9. Some letters have also been assigned to vertices of G, as can be seen from the following picture:\n\n\n\n\n\tLet\'s consider a walk W in graph G, which consists of L vertices W1, W2, ..., WL, such that Wi is connected with Wi + 1 for 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i < L. A string S of L letters \'A\'-\'E\' is realized by walk W if the sequence of letters written along W is equal to S. Vertices can be visited multiple times while walking along W.\n\nFor example, S = \'ABBECCD\' is realized by W = (0, 1, 6, 9, 7, 2, 3).\nYour task is to determine whether there is a walk W which realizes a given string S in graph G, and if so, find the lexicographically least such walk.\nInput\n\n\tThe first line of the input contains one integer T denoting the number of testcases to process.\n\n\n\tThe only line of each testcase contains one string S. It is guaranteed that S only consists of symbols \'A\'-\'E\'.\n\nOutput\n\n\tThe output should contain exactly T lines, one line per each testcase in the order of their appearance. For each testcase, if there is no walk W which realizes S, then output -1. Otherwise, you should output the least lexicographical walk W which realizes S. Since all of the vertices are numbered from 0 to 9, then it can be encoded as a string consisting of symbols \'0\'-\'9\' (see the "Examples" section for more details).\n\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 8;\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 |S| \xe2\x89\xa4 100000(105).\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\nAAB\nAABE501\n-1'
