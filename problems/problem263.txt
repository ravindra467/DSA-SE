b"Problem\nRead problems statements in Russian.\nThere's an N\xc3\x97NN \\times NN\xc3\x97N grid where each cell of the grid contains a positive integer. Let Vi,jV_{i,j}Vi,j\xe2\x80\x8b be the positive integer on the cell positioned iii-th rows from the top and jjj-th columns from the left.\nInitially, Alice is at position (Ax,Ay)(A_x, A_y)(Ax\xe2\x80\x8b,Ay\xe2\x80\x8b) and Bob is at (Bx,By)(B_x, B_y)(Bx\xe2\x80\x8b,By\xe2\x80\x8b). Both players can move like a chess king on the grid: one step horizontally, vertically or diagonally. They can't move out of the grid or stay in the same cell.\nAlice starts with an initial score of 000. The game proceeds as follows:\n\nAlice moves to a neighboring cell of her choice (horizontally, vertically or diagonally). Her score increases by the integer on the cell she just moved to.\nIf Alice and Bob are in the same cell, then the game ends, else Bob moves to a neighboring cell of his choice.\nIf Alice and Bob are in the same cell, then the game ends, else go to step 1.\n\nThe goal of Alice is to maximize her score. The goal of Bob is to minimize Alice's score. Both players play optimally. It can be proven that the game will end in a finite number of iterations.\nYou need to find the maximum score Alice can achieve.\nNote: Over the course of the game, Alice can revisit cells multiple times. She gets the corresponding value added to her score each time she visits it.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains an integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The TTT test cases then follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains four integers N,Ax,Ay,Bx,ByN, A_x, A_y, B_x, B_yN,Ax\xe2\x80\x8b,Ay\xe2\x80\x8b,Bx\xe2\x80\x8b,By\xe2\x80\x8b denoting the size of the grid, the row coordinate of Alice's position, the column coordinate of Alice's position, the row coordinate of Bob's position, and the column coordinate of Bob's position respectively.\nThe next NNN lines of each test case have NNN integers each. The jjj-th integer in the iii-th line denotes Vi,jV_{i,j}Vi,j\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output on one line the score Alice will have if both Alice and Bob play optimally.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4601 \\le T \\le 601\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa460\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa43002 \\le N \\le 3002\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4300\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Vi,j\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\le V_{i,j} \\le 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Vi,j\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ax,Ay,Bx,By\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le A_x,A_y,B_x,B_y \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4Ax\xe2\x80\x8b,Ay\xe2\x80\x8b,Bx\xe2\x80\x8b,By\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4N\n(Ax,Ay)\xe2\x89\xa0(Bx,By)(A_x, A_y) \\neq (B_x, B_y)(Ax\xe2\x80\x8b,Ay\xe2\x80\x8b)\xee\x80\xa0=(Bx\xe2\x80\x8b,By\xe2\x80\x8b)\nSum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 300300300\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n2 1 1 2 2\n1 10\n5 6\n4 4 4 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 10 1\n1 1 1 10\n4 1 3 1 4\n1 2 3 4\n2 1 4 3\n3 4 1 2\n4 3 2 1\n10\n30\n8\n\nExplanation:\n\n\nFor the first test case, Alice moves to position (1,2)(1, 2)(1,2) and gets 101010 points. Bob then moves to (1,2)(1, 2)(1,2) and catches Alice. This is the optimal gameplay.\n\n\nFor the second test case, Alice moves to (3,3)(3, 3)(3,3) and gets 101010 points. Bob moves to (2,2)(2, 2)(2,2). Then Alice moves to (4,4)(4,4)(4,4) and gets another 101010 points. Bob them moves to (3,3)(3, 3)(3,3). Finally, Alice moves to (3,3)(3, 3)(3,3) gaining a total of 303030 points. The game ends as Alice and Bob are in the same cell. This is a possible optimal gameplay.\n\n\nFor the third test case, the GIF below shows a possible optimal gameplay\n\n\n"
