b"Problem\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nThe kingdom of Treeland consists of NNN cities (numbered 111 through NNN) connected by N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 bidirectional roads in such a way that there is a path between each pair of cities.\nIn order to increase security in Treeland, the government decided to set up police offices in KKK of its cities. For each valid iii, the iii-th office is in city ViV_iVi\xe2\x80\x8b and it has a radius of efficiency RiR_iRi\xe2\x80\x8b.\nLet's define the security level SiS_iSi\xe2\x80\x8b of each city iii as follows:\n\nInitially, the security level of each city is equal to zero.\nThen, for each police office jjj that was built (1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4K1 \\le j \\le K1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4K), the security levels change in the following manner:\n\nThe security level of the city VjV_jVj\xe2\x80\x8b increases by RjR_jRj\xe2\x80\x8b.\nThe security levels of all cities at the distance 111 from VjV_jVj\xe2\x80\x8b increase by Rj\xe2\x88\x921R_j-1Rj\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\x921.\n...\nThe security levels of all cities at the distance Rj\xe2\x88\x921R_j-1Rj\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\x921 from VjV_jVj\xe2\x80\x8b increase by 111.\n\n\nFormally, for each city iii, the jjj-th office increases the security level of this city by max(0,Rj\xe2\x88\x92distance(i,Vj))\\mathrm{max}(0, R_j - \\mathrm{distance}(i, V_j))max(0,Rj\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\x92distance(i,Vj\xe2\x80\x8b)).\n\nAlice was in charge of calculating the new security levels of all cities after the offices were built. She already finished her job and noticed an interesting coincidence: for each valid iii, SVi=RiS_{V_i} = R_iSVi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b=Ri\xe2\x80\x8b holds. Now she has challenged you to find the security levels of all cities.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and KKK.\nThen, N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers uuu and vvv denoting that cities uuu and vvv are connected by a road.\nKKK more lines follow. For each valid iii, the iii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers ViV_iVi\xe2\x80\x8b and RiR_iRi\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing NNN space-separated integers S1,S2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SNS_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_NS1\xe2\x80\x8b,S2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,SN\xe2\x80\x8b.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42,0001 \\le T \\le 2,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42,000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa48\xe2\x8b\x851052 \\le N, K \\le 8 \\cdot 10^52\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa48\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le u, v \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Vi\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le V_i \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4Vi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid iii\nV1,V2,\xe2\x80\xa6,VKV_1, V_2, \\ldots, V_KV1\xe2\x80\x8b,V2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,VK\xe2\x80\x8b are pairwise distinct\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ri1 \\le R_i1\xe2\x89\xa4Ri\xe2\x80\x8b for each valid iii\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 8\xe2\x8b\x851058 \\cdot 10^58\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n5 2\n5 2\n5 4\n5 3\n3 1\n2 1\n5 1\n5 2\n5 2\n1 2\n2 4\n3 1\n4 2\n5 20 1 0 0 1\n0 2 0 2 2"
