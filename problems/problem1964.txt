b'Problem\nChef has finally finished school and is now deciding to go to a university, however, Chef is confused between so many universities he can go to. Chef lives in Byteland, which has NNN cities, connected to each other by MMM road each of length 1 kilometer. Each city has exaclty 1 university. Chef currently lives in city 1. Oddly, he is going to decide which university he wants to attend by two factors: the shortest distance to the city from his house and the number of cities adjacent to the city connected by a road of 1 km.\nHe has QQQ queries regarding this. In each query he wants to know whether there exists a university which has a shortest distance of exactly DDD km from his house, and has exactly KKK adjacent cities.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain three integers, NNN, MMM, and QQQ\nThe next MMM lines will contain two integers, u and v, which means that there is a biderectional road from city v to city u\nThe next QQQ lines will contain two integers, DDD and KKK.\n\nOutput:\nFor each query, output on a new line, "YES" if there exists a city following Chef\'s criteria, else output "NO"(without "").\nConstraints\n\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41052 \\leq N \\leq 10^52\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq M \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4D,K\xe2\x89\xa4N0 \\leq D, K \\leq N0\xe2\x89\xa4D,K\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq u, v \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\nu\xe2\x89\xa0vu \\neq vu\xee\x80\xa0=v\nBetween each pair of cities, there can be atmost 1 road (no multi-edges)\nThe graph is connected\n\nSubtasks\n\n30 points : Q=1Q = 1Q=1\n70 points : 1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq Q \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\nSample Input:\n6 8 4\n1 3\n3 5\n3 4\n2 4\n4 6\n5 6\n1 5\n2 6\n1 3\n1 2\n4 2\n4 3### Sample Output:\nYES\nNO\nNO\nNO\n### EXPLANATION:\n\nQuery 1: City 3 is 1 km away and has 3 adjacent cities\nQuery 2, 3, 4: No such city exists'
