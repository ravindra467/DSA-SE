b'Problem\n\nIt\'s ICPC season! Rishi and Himanshu are preparing for ACM ICPC. Now Subbareddy sir being ICPC coach wants to check their progress, so he wants them to solve the following problem.\nSubba Reddy gives them a directory of words which contains N words. Later he asks them Q queries containing two integers L and R, where L and R are indices (1-indexed).\nRishi and Himanshu need  to find the number of distinct anagrams in the range L to R (L and R included).\n\nInput\n\nFirst line constains an integer N, number of words.\nFor Next N lines, each line contains a string S, a word in the directory.\nNext line contains an integer Q, number of queries. \nNow for next Q lines, each line contains two integers L and R seperated by space.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each query print the number of distinct anagrams in given range L to R (L and R both inclusive).\n\nConstraints\n\n1 <= N <= 100000\n1 <= |S| <= 15 (length of string)\nAll the characters of strings are lowercase and between \'a\' to \'e\'.\n1 <= Q <= 100000\n1 <= L <= R <=  N \n\nExample\nInput:\n5\nabc \nac \ncab \nde \nca\n4\n1 3\n2 4\n1 5\n2 5\nOutput:\n2\n3\n3\n3\nExplanation:-\nFor first query(1 to 3) strings "abc" and "cab" are anagrams so number of total distinct elements will be 2.\nFor third query(1 to 5) strings "abc" and "cab" are anagrams and "ac" and "ca" are anagrams so total disticnt anagrams will be 3.\n\n\n '
