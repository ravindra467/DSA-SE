The first\nline contain two space separated integer N and K.\nThe next line of the input will contain N space seprated\nintegers, which are the taste number of the r th carrot Ar\n dug by the i th\nrabbit.\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\n\nFor each test case output a single integer denoting the number\nof carrots which can be eaten by the ith rabbit on a\nnew line.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ar \xe2\x89\xa4 1018\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n3\n5 2\n14 17 4 16 64\n3 9\n9 5 81\n4 7\n343 14 25 5764801\nOutput:\n3\n2\n2\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nExample case 1.\nThere are three carrots whose taste number is a power of 2\nExample case 2.\nThere are two carrots whose taste number is a power of 9."
