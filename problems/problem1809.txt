b'Problem\nChef has NNN new recruits lined up. HiH_iHi\xe2\x80\x8b denotes height of ithi_{th}ith\xe2\x80\x8b recruit. Chef tells a positive integer KKK to you and asks you to arrange the recruits such that first KKK recruits are in increasing order of height, next KKK are in decreasing order of height and so on. Tell the new standing order of recruits.\r\nNote: The last portion of recruits will be less than or equal to KKK.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain NNN, number of recruits.\nSecond line contains height of NNN recruits in inital standing order.\nThird line contains integer KKK.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a new order of recruits,\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\leq N \\leq 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Hi\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq H_i \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Hi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq K \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1(100 points): Original Constraints\n\nSample Input:\n5\r\n1 2 3 7 5\r\n2\n\nSample Output:\n1 2 7 3 5\n'
