b"Problem\nThe mayor of Townsville City wants to build a telephone network in the city.\nThe city is represented as a square grid of size NNN x NNN. Rows and columns of the grid are numbered from 111 to NNN. Each cell of the grid (i,j)(i, j)(i,j) has a tower of height Hi,jH_{i, j}Hi,j\xe2\x80\x8b. The height of each tower is between 111 and KKK (inclusive). It is guaranteed that there is at least one tower of each height in the city.\n\nThe mayor's engineering team wants to use exactly K\xe2\x88\x921K - 1K\xe2\x88\x921 cables to create the network.\nThe first cable should be between a tower of height 111 and a tower of height 222, the second cable should be between a tower of height 222 and a tower of height 333, and so on with the (K\xe2\x88\x921)th(K - 1)^{th}(K\xe2\x88\x921)th cable connecting a tower of height (K\xe2\x88\x921)(K - 1)(K\xe2\x88\x921) and a tower of height KKK, i.e., a chain of cables needs to be created in the height order 1,2,3,...,K1, 2, 3, ... , K1,2,3,...,K.\nThe cost of connecting two cells (i1,j1)(i_1, j_1)(i1\xe2\x80\x8b,j1\xe2\x80\x8b) and (i2,j2)(i_2, j_2)(i2\xe2\x80\x8b,j2\xe2\x80\x8b) is \xe2\x88\xa3i2\xe2\x88\x92i1\xe2\x88\xa3+\xe2\x88\xa3j2\xe2\x88\x92j1\xe2\x88\xa3|i_2 - i_1| + |j_2 - j_1|\xe2\x88\xa3i2\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\x92i1\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\xa3+\xe2\x88\xa3j2\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\x92j1\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\xa3.\nFor all iii such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4i<K1 \\leq i \\lt K1\xe2\x89\xa4i<K, the ithi^{th}ith and (i+1)th(i+1)^{th}(i+1)th cables should have one tower in common.\n\nFind the minimum total cost of the chain of cables required to build the telephone network.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains 222 space-separated integers NNN and KKK.\nNNN lines follow. Each line contains NNN space-separated integers. The jthj^{th}jth number in the ithi^{th}ith line represents Hi,jH_{i, j}Hi,j\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the minimum cost of cables used.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le T \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le N \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N21 \\le K \\le N^21\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N2\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Hi,j\xe2\x89\xa4K1 \\le H_{i, j} \\le K1\xe2\x89\xa4Hi,j\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4K for each valid (i,j)(i, j)(i,j)\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 100100100\n\nExample Input\n1\n3 3\n1 1 1\n2 2 2\n3 3 3\n\nExample Output\n2\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1:\n\nOne of the chains that can be formed with minimum cost is (1,1)(1, 1)(1,1) -> (2,1)(2, 1)(2,1) -\\gt (3,1)(3, 1)(3,1) with cost 222.\nEven though (1,2)(1, 2)(1,2) -> (2,3)(2, 3)(2,3) -\\gt (3,1)(3, 1)(3,1) is also a valid chain (among other valid chains), it's cost is 555 which is not the minimum.\n"
