b"Problem\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.\nChef Ada is training to defend her title of World Chess Champion.\nTo train her calculation skills, Ada placed a king on a chessboard. Remember that a chessboard has 888 rows and 888 columns (for the purposes of this problem, both the rows and the columns are numbered 111 through 888); let's denote the square in row rrr and column ccc by (r,c)(r, c)(r,c). A king on a square (r,c)(r, c)(r,c) can move to another square (r\xe2\x80\xb2,c\xe2\x80\xb2)(r', c')(r\xe2\x80\xb2,c\xe2\x80\xb2) if and only if (r\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x88\x92r)2+(c\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x88\x92c)2\xe2\x89\xa42(r'-r)^2+(c'-c)^2 \\le 2(r\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x88\x92r)2+(c\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x88\x92c)2\xe2\x89\xa42.\nAda placed her king on the square (R,C)(R, C)(R,C). Now, she is counting the number of squares that can be visited (reached) by the king in at most KKK moves. Help Ada verify her answers.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers RRR, CCC and KKK.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of squares the king can visit.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45121 \\le T \\le 5121\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4512\n1\xe2\x89\xa4R,C,K\xe2\x89\xa481 \\le R, C, K \\le 81\xe2\x89\xa4R,C,K\xe2\x89\xa48\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n1 3 16\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: The king can stay on its original square or move to one of the squares circled in the following figure.\n"
