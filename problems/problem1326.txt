b'Problem\n\nIn the magic land, there is an annual parade hold on each spring.\n\n\nThere are N cities in magic land, and M directed roads between cities.\n\nOn the parade, there will be some(may be 0) heroes travel in this land, for each hero:\nHe start at city begin[i], traveling to some cities, and finish at city end[i]. Note that: begin[i] may be equals to end[i], but he must at least moved to another city during this travel. He can go on one road many times, but it will have a cost for each time.\n\n\nThe cost of this parade is the sum of these items:\n\n1. The sum of costs by traveling on roads. (If a road is passed by k heroes, then it must be count k times.)\n\n2. If for a hero, he ended at a city that not equals to his start city, i.e. begin[i] != end[i], then it will cost C dollars to move him back to his home.\n\n3. If for a city, there is no heroes visited, then we must pay for the citizen C dollars as compensate.\n\n\nThe value of C may change every year, and we can predict this value in the following K years. \nYour task is: calculate the minimal cost of each year.\n\nInput\n\nIn the first line, there are 3 integers: N, M and K.\n\nIn the following M lines:\n\nthere will be 3 integers: S[i], T[i], and V[i], describing a directed road from S[i] to T[i], cost V[i] dollars.\n\nIn the next K lines:\nThere will be an integer: C[i], describing the value of C in that year.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput K lines:\neach line contain an integer, corresponding to the minimal cost of each year.\nConstraints\n2 <= N <= 250\n\n1 <= M <= 30000\n\n1 <= K <= 10000\n\nS[i] != T[i], 1 <= S[i], T[i] <= N\n\n1 <= V[i] <= 10000\n\n1 <= C <= 10000\n\nNote that: there may be more than 1 road between a certain pair of cities.\nExample\nInput:\n6 5 3\n1 3 2\n2 3 2\n3 4 2\n4 5 2\n4 6 2\n1\n5\n10\nOutput:\n6\n21\n32\n\n\nExplanation\n\nIn the first year, since C is very small, an optimal solution is: no hero travel, we pay 1 dollar for each city as compensate.\n\nIn the second year, an optimal solution is: One hero traveling in the path: 1->3->4->5. We pay 2+2+2=6 dollars for the roads, 5 dollars for taking him back to city 1, and pay 5 dollars for city 2 and 6 as compensate.\n\nIn the third year, one optimal solution is: One hero traveling in the path: 1->3->4->5, and another hero traveling in the path: 2->3->4->6.'
