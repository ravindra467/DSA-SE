b"Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian \n\nChef the chief is participating in a hill jumping competition.\n\n\nThere are N hills arranged in a row, and each of them is assigned a unique index from 1 to N \xe2\x80\x94 the ith hill has an index Pi on it. The height of the ith hill is Hi.\nChef starts at the first hill with a goal to reach the Nth hill by jumping over hills from left to right (he is not allowed to jump in the other direction), jumping from ith hill to jth costs (Hj - Hi)2 energy.\n\n\nWhen chief is on the ith hill, he has to prepare a special dish for the community of that hill as a thanks for letting him use their resources. This will cost him Ai energy (some dishes are chief's favorites and preparing it refreshes chef that why Ai may be negative). To make things more challenging for Chef the chief, he is allowed to jump from ith hill to jth if and only if i < j and Pi < Pj.\n\n\nHelp Chef choose the sequence of jumps that consume the minimum energy possible. (Note that it's possible at any moment that energy consumed is negative.)\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer N.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers P1, P2, ... , PN.\nThe third line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ... , AN.\nThe fourth line contains N space-separated integers H1, H2, ... , HN.\n\nOutput\nOutput a single line containing the answer to the problem i.e. the minimal possible amount of consumed energy.\nConstraints\n\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 3 \xc3\x97 105\nP is a permutation of the first N integer numbers\nP1=1 and PN=N\n-109 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Hi \xe2\x89\xa4 6 \xc3\x97 105\n\nSubtasks\n\n\nSubtask 1 (5 points) : 2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 20\nSubtask 2 (15 points) : 2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 5000\nSubtask 3 (20 points) : 2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 3 \xc3\x97 105, Pi = Hi = i\nSubtask 4 (30 points) : 2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 3 \xc3\x97 105, Hi = i\nSubtask 5 (30 points) : original constraints\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n5\n1 4 3 2 5\n0 1 3 0 0\n1 2 3 4 5\nOutput:\n10\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. jumping from first hill to 4th one then to 5th; the answer will be 0 + 0 + 0 + (4-1)^2 + (5-4)^2 = 10"
