b"Problem\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nMinion Chef likes to eat bananas a lot. There are N piles of bananas in front of Chef; for each i (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 N), the i-th pile contains Ai bananas.\nChef's mother wants her to eat the bananas and be healthy. She has gone to the office right now and will come back in H hours. Chef would like to make sure that she can finish eating all bananas by that time.\nSuppose Chef has an eating speed of K bananas per hour. Each hour, she will choose some pile of bananas. If this pile contains at least K bananas, then she will eat K bananas from it. Otherwise, she will simply eat the whole pile (and won't eat any more bananas during this hour).\nChef likes to eat slowly, but still wants to finish eating all the bananas on time. Therefore, she would like to choose the minimum K such that she is able to eat all the bananas in H hours. Help Chef find that value of K.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and H denoting the number of piles and the number of hours after which Chef's mom will come home.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN.\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum possible value of K.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\nN \xe2\x89\xa4 H \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 109 for each valid i\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points):\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100\nAi \xe2\x89\xa4 103 for each valid i\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n3 3\n1 2 3\n3 4\n1 2 3\n4 5\n4 3 2 73\n2\n4\nExplanation:\nTest case 111: Chef can choose K=3K = 3K=3 bananas per hour. This way,\n\nIn the first hour, Chef eats the pile 111 as the number of bananas in the pile is less than equal to 333.\nIn the second hour, Chef eats the pile 222 as the number of bananas in the pile is less than equal to 333.\nIn the third hour, Chef eats the pile 333 as the number of bananas in the pile is less than equal to 333.\n\nChef can finish eating all the bananas in 333 hours. It can be shown that 333 bananas per hour is the minimum possible speed with which Chef can finish all bananas in 333 hours.\nTest case 222: Chef can choose K=2K = 2K=2 bananas per hour. This way,\n\nIn the first hour, Chef eats the pile 111 as the number of bananas in the pile is less than equal to 222.\nIn the second hour, Chef eats the pile 222 as the number of bananas in the pile is less than equal to 222.\nIn the third hour, Chef eats the 222 bananas from pile 333. 111 banana is left in pile 333.\nIn the fourth hour, Chef eats the remaining banana from pile 333 as the number of bananas in the pile is less than equal to 222.\n\nChef can finish eating all the bananas in 444 hours. It can be shown that 222 bananas per hour is the minimum possible speed with which Chef can finish all bananas in 444 hours.\nTest case 333: Chef can choose K=4K = 4K=4 bananas per hour. This way,\n\nIn the first hour, Chef eats the pile 111 as the number of bananas in the pile is less than equal to 444.\nIn the second hour, Chef eats the pile 222 as the number of bananas in the pile is less than equal to 444.\nIn the third hour, Chef eats the pile 333 as the number of bananas in the pile is less than equal to 444.\nIn the fourth hour, Chef eats the 444 bananas from pile 444. 333 bananas are left in pile 444.\nIn the fifth hour, Chef eats the remaining bananas from pile 444 as the number of bananas in the pile is less than equal to 444.\n\nChef can finish eating all the bananas in 555 hours. It can be shown that 444 bananas per hour is the minimum possible speed with which Chef can finish all bananas in 555 hours."
