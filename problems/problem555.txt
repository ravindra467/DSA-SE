He goes to Ankit and asks him to solve a problem. There are NNN varieties of soup in the party and NNN identical bowls are placed on Simmi's plate. Rinku has a favorite number maxmaxmax and Simmi's favorite number is 222. Rinku asks Ankit to tell him the maximum value of NNN such that the total number of ways of selecting the soups are less than Rinku's favorite number. The variety of different soups on Simmi's plate is at least equal to her favorite number. Note that bowls can also be empty.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nEach test case contains of a single line of input, one integers maxmaxmax denoting Rinku's favorite number.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line answer given by Ankit to Rinku modulo 1000000007.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq T \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4max\xe2\x89\xa41092 \\leq max \\leq 10^92\xe2\x89\xa4max\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSample Input:\n5\n150\n1000\n420\n100\n50\n\nSample Output:\n4\n6\n5\n4\n3\n"
