b'Problem\nOur Lonely Vijju is feeling sooo lonely that Sometimes he talks (rather shouts at god), "Why god, Why me!!!!, Where did i go wrong." The god had blessed him with only one thing ever, his IQ (Intelligence Quotient). He has the IQ NNN.\nGod Taran had some mercy on him and granted him a superpower, that he can share his IQ with anyone and make him is friend. Formally, God Taran gave him an array BBB of length KKK. Vijju can partition his IQ into KKK parts represented by array AAA, with condition that 0\xe2\x89\xa4A[i]\xe2\x89\xa4B[i]0 \\leq A[i] \\leq B[i]0\xe2\x89\xa4A[i]\xe2\x89\xa4B[i]. If A[i]>B[i]A[i]>B[i]A[i]>B[i], he will invite wrath of Mighty Taran, something he\'s deeply scared of and wants to avoid.\nBut, having high IQ, Vijju thinks the number of ways he can do so, without attracting Wrath of Lord Taran.\nVijju found this answer, but he ask you to verify his answer by solving this problem.\nTwo Partitions A1A_1A1\xe2\x80\x8b and A2A_2A2\xe2\x80\x8b differ if A1[i]\xe2\x89\xa0A2[i]A_1 [i] \\neq A_2 [i]A1\xe2\x80\x8b[i]\xee\x80\xa0=A2\xe2\x80\x8b[i] for any position i.\nVijju knows this problem is not for people with less IQ, so he ask you to find answer modulo 109+910^9+9109+9.\nInput\n\nFirst line contains an Integer TTT denoting number of test cases. Each test case consist of two lines.\nFor every test case, First line contains two integers NNN and KKK, as explained above.\nNext line contains KKK integers, specifying array BBB.\n\nOutput\n\nFor every test case, output in a single line the number of ways to form array AAA. If no possible array exist, print 0.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq T \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,K,B[i]\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq N, K, B[i] \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4N,K,B[i]\xe2\x89\xa4100.\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (15 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq K \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa410\nSubtask 2 (85 points): Original Constraints.\n\nSample Input\n2\n8 3\n3 3 3\n8 3\n4 4 4\nSample Output\n3\n15\nExplanation\nIn first sample, all possible arrays AAA are [2,3,3][2,3,3][2,3,3], [3,2,3][3,2,3][3,2,3] and [3,3,2][3,3,2][3,3,2].'
