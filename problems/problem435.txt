b'Problem\nVedant has just arrived in Bengal and now he wants to taste the best rasgullas of the country, so he goes to the world famous sweet store there. The shopkeeper has kept NNN rasgullas on the coordinate axis, at coordinates 1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6.N1 , 2 , \xe2\x80\xa6. N1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6.N.\nVedant cannot eat one rasgulla more than once. The initial tastiness of all the rasgullas is 000. As he is in the best sweet store, the rasgullas are very sweet and syrupy. So, when he eats a rasgulla , (suppose at coordinate iii) ,it\xe2\x80\x99s syrup spreads ,and the rasgullas which lie between points [i\xe2\x88\x92di,i+di][ i - d_{i} , i + d_{i} ][i\xe2\x88\x92di\xe2\x80\x8b,i+di\xe2\x80\x8b] , undergo a taste-change, wherein the tastiness of each of these  rasgullas increases by cic_{i}ci\xe2\x80\x8b. Whenever he eats a rasgulla, his happiness increases by the current tastiness of the eaten rasgulla.\nVedant can eat the NNN rasgullas in any order. As Vedant wants to enjoy his visit to Bengal as much as possible, he asks you to tell the maximum possible happiness he can achieve by eating the rasgullas!\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input consists of a single integer NNN\nThe next line contains NNN spaced integers:\n\nd1,d2,...,dNd_{1},d_{2},...,d_{N}d1\xe2\x80\x8b,d2\xe2\x80\x8b,...,dN\xe2\x80\x8b\n\n\nThe next line contains NNN spaced integers:\n\nc1,c2,...,cNc_{1},c_{2},...,c_{N}c1\xe2\x80\x8b,c2\xe2\x80\x8b,...,cN\xe2\x80\x8b\n\n\n\nOutput Format\nA single integer denoting the maximum possible happiness of Vedant.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq N \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n0\xe2\x89\xa4di\xe2\x89\xa470 \\leq d_{i} \\leq 70\xe2\x89\xa4di\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa47\n0\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa410000 \\leq c_{i} \\leq 1000 0\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa41000\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput5\n1 0 1 1 2\n1 3 7 4 5\n25\n\nExplanation:\n\nVedant can eat rasgullas from coordinates in order :\n[5,3,1,2,4][5,3,1,2,4][5,3,1,2,4] , and can achieve a happiness value of 25.\n'
