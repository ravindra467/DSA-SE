b"Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nThere are a lot of problems related to the shortest paths. Nevertheless, there are not much problems, related to the shortest paths in average.\nConsider a directed graph G, consisting of N nodes and M edges. Consider a walk from the node A to the node B in this graph. The average length of this walk will be total sum of weight of its' edges divided by number of edges. Every edge counts as many times as it appears in this path.\nNow, your problem is quite simple. For the given graph and two given nodes, find out the shortest average length of the walk between these nodes. Please note, that the length of the walk need not to be finite, but average walk length will be.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a pair of space-separated integers N and M denoting the number of nodes and the number of edges in the graph.\nEach of the following M lines contains a triple of space-separated integers Xi Yi Zi, denoting the arc, connecting the node Xi to the node Yi (but not vice-versa!) having the weight of Zi.\nThe next line contains a pair of space separated integers A and B, denoting the first and the last node of the path.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the length of the shortest path in average.\nIf there is no path at all, output just -1 on the corresponding line of the output.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 500\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\nA is not equal to B\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 A, B, Xi, Yi \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Zi \xe2\x89\xa4 100\nThere are no self-loops and multiple edges in the graph.\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 sum of N over all test cases \xe2\x89\xa4 10000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 sum of M over all test cases \xe2\x89\xa4 20000\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 (45 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 10, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 20; Your answer will be considered correct in case it has an absolute or relative error of no more than 10-2.\nSubtask #2 (55 points): no additional constraints; Your answer will be considered correct in case it has an absolute or relative error of no more than 10-6.\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n3 3\n1 2 1\n2 3 2\n3 2 3\n1 3\n3 3\n1 2 10\n2 3 1\n3 2 1\n1 3\nOutput:\n1.5\n1.0\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. The walk 1 -> 2 and 2 -> 3 has average length of 3/2 = 1.5. Any other walks in the graph will have more or equal average length than this."
