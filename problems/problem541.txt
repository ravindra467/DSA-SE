b'Problem\n\xc2\xa0\nProblem description.\nYou are given two sequences of N elements P and Q. You have to partition them where the cost of making a partition from index L to R is cost = min(P[L...N])*max(Q[1...R]). Find the minimum and the maximum cost of partitioning the two sequences into exactly K partitions. Remember, the partitions of the two sequences must be the same, you cannot make different partitions for P and Q.\nInput\nInput description.\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains a two integers N and K denoting the number of elements in the sequences and the number of partitions to be made. Then follows N lines, each line containing two integers, the first element corresponding the P and the second integer corresponding to Q.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing two integers denoting minimum and maximum cost.\nConstraints\n\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n-105 \xe2\x89\xa4 Pi, Qi \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1(9 points):\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\nK = 2\n\nSubtask #2(16 points):\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Pi, Qi \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n\nSubtask #3(27 points):\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n\nSubtask #4(48 points):\n\nOriginal Constraints\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n5 1\n1 1\n2 2\n3 3\n4 4\n5 5\n5 5\n1 1\n2 2\n3 3\n4 4\n5 5\n5 2\n1 1\n2 2\n3 3\n4 4\n5 5\nOutput:\n5 5\n55 55\n11 29\n\n\nExplanation\n\nExample case 1.\nThere is only one way to partition the elements and that is to keep everything in the same partition, i.e, [1, 5]. The cost is min(P[1..N])*max(Q[1..N]) = 1*5 = 5.\nThis is both the maximum and the minimum possible.\n'
