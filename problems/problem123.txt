b"Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\n\nYou are given a string s consisting of upper case Latin alphabets, i.e. from 'A' to 'Z'. Your task is to find how many strings t with length equal to that of S, also consisting of upper case Latin alphabet are there satisfying the following conditions:\n\nString t is lexicographical larger than s\nWhen you write both s and t in the reverse order, t is still lexicographical larger than s.\n\n\n\nFind out number of such strings t. As the answer could be very large, output it modulo 109 + 7\n\nInput\n\nThe only line of input contains string s.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput a single line containing an integer corresponding to the result in modulo 109 + 7.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 |S| \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n\nExample\nInput 1:\nZAZ\nOutput 1:\n25\nInput 2:\nXYZ\nOutput 2:\n5\n\nExplanation\n\nTest #1: To make a valid string t, you can just replace the letter A in S by any other letter, e.g. by replacing 'A' by 'B', we get t = ZBZ. Note that ZBZ is lexicographically larger than ZAZ. Reverse of t (i.e. ZBZ) is also lexicographically larger than reverse of s (i.e. ZAZ).\n\n\nTest #2: there are 5 valid strings: YYZ, ZYZ, XZZ, YZZ, ZZZ\n"
