b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has a string S with length N. As Chef really likes his name, he defines the chefness of a string as the number of ways to find the string "chef" as a subsequence in S; formally, it\'s the number of ways to choose four indices i, j, k, l such that Si = \'c\', Sj = \'h\', Sk = \'e\', Sl = \'f\' and 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 j \xe2\x89\xa4 k \xe2\x89\xa4 l \xe2\x89\xa4 N. For example, the chefness of "chehefc" is 3 (with subsequences given by indices (1, 2, 3, 6), (1, 2, 5, 6), (1, 4, 5, 6)).\nChef perfectly understands that people really don\'t like strings with chefness greater than K. Therefore, he wants to erase a number of characters (possibly zero) from S in order to obtain a string with chefness equal to K. Help him compute the minimum number of characters he has to erase in order to achieve that!\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.\nThe second line contains a string S with length N.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of characters that need to be erased from S in order to obtain a string with chefness K, or -1 if it\'s impossible.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 32\neach character in S is one of the letters \'c\', \'h\', \'e\', \'f\'\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 256\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 sum of N over all test cases \xe2\x89\xa4 256\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput5\n7 3\nchehefc\n8 4\nchehefch\n19 24\nccccchhhhheeeeeffff\n20 5\nechhhfhfcecfhechfcch\n99 27\nffhffhffcfechchccccfhhhfhhhhhhehhhehhhhheeeeefeeeeeeheeheeeeffcfffffffffffhffffchffeffcefefhhfcehfe0\n-1\n9\n3\n9\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: The chefness of S is already equal to 3, hence it\'s enough to erase nothing.\nExample case 2: Chefness is again equal to 3, but it\'s impossible to achieve chefness 4.\nExample case 3: Chefness 24 can be achieved by erasing 4 letters \'c\', 3 letters \'h\' and 2 letters \'e\'.'
