b'Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.\nYou are given an undirected graph, you need to find the shortest walk in the graph from source to sink which satisfies the following property:  \nLet the shortest walk from source to sink be through edges E1 -> E2 -> ... -> Ek, then Weight(E1) > Weight(E2) < Weight(E3)  > Weight(E4) .....and so on.  \nFormally, the difference between adjacent edge weights in shortest walk should keep on switching from positive to negative and from negative to positive. And the first difference should be positive.\nInput Format\nFirst Line contains T, the number of Test cases.\nFirst line of each test case contains N the number of nodes and M the number of edges.  \nNext M lines follows, each line contains 3 integers X, Y and Z, which denotes that there is an edge from X to Y with weight Z.  \nNext line contains 2 integer source and sink.  \nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print the shortest walk satisfying the property. If no such walk exists then print "No Solution".  \nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Sum of N over all test cases \xe2\x89\xa4 100000 \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Sum of M over all test cases \xe2\x89\xa4 500000 \n3 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100000   \n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 500000   \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 2000 \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Z \xe2\x89\xa4 100000000  \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 X,Y \xe2\x89\xa4 N  \n X != Y \nsource !=  sink and there are no multi edges.\nsource and sink will not be connected by a direct edge\n\nSample Input\n3\n5 6\n4 2 8\n1 4 6\n2 3 10\n3 1 10\n1 2 3\n3 5 3\n4 3\n4 3\n1 4 4\n2 4 5\n2 3 6\n4 3\n5 5\n1 2 100\n2 3 80\n3 4 90\n4 2 85\n2 5 120\n1 5\n    \nSample Output\n19\nNo Solution\n475\n\nExplanation\nFor First Test Case: Shortest Valid Walk: 4->1->2->3  \nFor Second Test Case: There is no valid Walk satisfying the constraints.\n\n\nWarning: Large Input files, some files are upto 10 MB '
