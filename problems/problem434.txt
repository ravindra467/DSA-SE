b'Problem\nAbhishek is working in one of the best telecommunication companies of the world. He joined this company recently. To test his skills, his boss assigned him to help two of their customers: Aryan and Ali.\nInitially both of their phone numbers are empty (fantasy world you see). During each day , one of the following things can take place:\n\nLast digit of numbers of either Aryan or Ali can be erased.\nA new digit can be appended at the end of the numbers of either Aryan or Ali.\n\nThe company also has a magical number MMM of length NNN, where each digit is between 000 and 999 (both inclusive). The positions of digits are numbered from 111 to NNN, from left to right. Aryan and Ali will be happy if both of their numbers appear as non-overlapping subsequences of MMM.\nMore formally, suppose that Aryan chooses some positions from MMM such that the digits at those positions form his current number (in the same order).Let the positions be a1,a2,a3,...,apa_{1},a_{2},a_{3},...,a_{p}a1\xe2\x80\x8b,a2\xe2\x80\x8b,a3\xe2\x80\x8b,...,ap\xe2\x80\x8b . Now , Ali chooses some positions, not already chosen by Aryan such that the digits at those positions form his current number (in the same order).Let the positions be b1,b2,b3,...,bqb_{1},b_{2},b_{3},...,b_{q}b1\xe2\x80\x8b,b2\xe2\x80\x8b,b3\xe2\x80\x8b,...,bq\xe2\x80\x8b. Then the following conditions should hold true :\n\naia_{i}ai\xe2\x80\x8b as well as bib_{i}bi\xe2\x80\x8b are strictly increasing sequences.\nFor all pairs (ai,bj)(a_{i},b_{j})(ai\xe2\x80\x8b,bj\xe2\x80\x8b) 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4p1 \\leq i \\leq p1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4p, 1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4q1 \\leq j \\leq q1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4q, ai\xe2\x89\xa0bja_{i} \\neq b_{j}ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xee\x80\xa0=bj\xe2\x80\x8b.\nValues of aia_{i}ai\xe2\x80\x8b  are pairwise distinct. 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4p1 \\leq i \\leq p1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4p.\nValues of bib_{i}bi\xe2\x80\x8b  are pairwise distinct. 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4q1 \\leq i \\leq q1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4q.\nMa1Ma2Ma3....MapM_{a_{1}}M_{a_{2}}M_{a_{3}}....M_{a_{p}}Ma1\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bMa2\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bMa3\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b....Map\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b forms Aryan\'s number.\nMb1Mb2Mb3....MbqM_{b_{1}}M_{b_{2}}M_{b_{3}}....M_{b_{q}}Mb1\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bMb2\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bMb3\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b....Mbq\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b forms Ali\'s number.\n\nOver a period of DDD days, Abhishek has to follow one of the following instructions each day:\n\nappendappendappend xxx yyy : You have to append digit yyy to the end of xxx\'s number.\neraseeraseerase xxx : Erase the last digit from xxx\'s number.\n\nAbhishek has to help these customers over a period of DDD days. As he is a new employee, he asks for your help.\nFor each of the DDD days, you have to tell whether the phone numbers of Aryan and Ali appear as non-overlapping subsequences of MMM.\nNOTE : Prefer using fast I/O methods, as the input is large.\nInput Format\n\nFirst line will contain two spaced integers NNN , DDD\nThe next line will contain the magical number MMM of length NNN\nDDD lines follow. Each of these lines will contain either of the following:\n\nappendappendappend xxx yyy : You have to append digit yyy to the end of xxx\'s number.\neraseeraseerase xxx : Erase the last digit from xxx\'s number.\n\n\n\nOutput Format\n\nPrint DDD lines. On the ithi^{th}ith line, print "YES" (without quotes) if both Aryan and Ali will be happy after the ithi^{th}ith day otherwise print "NO" (without quotes). You can print any character of the answer in any case, ie "yes", "YeS", "nO","No" etc will be considered valid response.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851051 \\leq N \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^{5}1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851041 \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^{4}1\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85104\nThe length of numbers of Aryan and Ali does not exceed 10310^3103\nMMM consists of digits from 000 to 999.\nxxx is either Aryan or Ali.\nyyy can be any digit from 000 to 999.\nDuring the erase operation, the corresponding person\'s number is non empty.\nThe numbers of Aryan, Ali and even the magical number MMM can contain leading zeroes.\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4 4\n0013\nappend Aryan 1\nappend Ali 0\nappend Ali 3\nappend Aryan 9\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\n\nExplanation:\n\n\nAt the end of first day, Aryan\'s number is 111 , while Ali\'s number is empty. Since 111 can be obtained as a subsequence of MMM, Aryan is happy. Ali is also happy(as his number is empty).\n\n\nAt the end of second day, numbers of Aryan and Ali are 111 and 000 respectively. Aryan can choose the subsequence formed by the digit at position 333 while Ali can choose the digit at position 111 . Since these are distinct positions , both will be happy.\n\n\nAt the end of third day, numbers of Aryan and Ali are 111 and 030303 respectively. Aryan can choose the same position as before, while Ali can choose positions 111 and 444. As these are distinct positions, both will be happy.\n\n\nAt the end of forth day, numbers of Aryan and Ali are 191919 and 030303 respectively. Since Aryan cannot choose any subsequence , he will be unhappy (Ali still being happy).\n\n\nSample 2:\nInputOutput7 10\n9784831\nappend Aryan 9\nappend Ali 7\nappend Aryan 8\nappend Aryan 1\nappend Ali 8\nappend Ali 4\nappend Ali 4\nappend Ali 0\nerase Ali\nerase Ali\nYES\nYES\nYES\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nNO\nYES\n'
