b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Hindi,\nMandarin chinese\n, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nSheokand is good at mathematics. One day, to test his math skills, Kaali gave him an integer NNN. To impress Kaali, Sheokand has to convert NNN into an integer MMM that can be represented in the form 2x+2y2^x + 2^y2x+2y (where xxx and yyy are non-negative integers such that x\xe2\x89\xa0yx \\neq yx\xee\x80\xa0=y). In order to do that, he can perform two types of operations:\n\nadd 111 to NNN\nsubtract 111 from NNN\n\nHowever, Sheokand is preparing for his exams. Can you help him find the minimum number of operations required to convert NNN into a valid integer MMM?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each testcase contains a single integer NNN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum required number of operations.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100,0001 \\le T \\le 100,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\le N \\le 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le T \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n10\n22\n40\n2\n1\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: N=10N=10N=10 is already in the form 2x+2y2^x + 2^y2x+2y, with x=3x=3x=3 and y=1y=1y=1.\nExample case 2: N=22N=22N=22 can be converted into M=20=22+24M=20=2^2+2^4M=20=22+24 or M=24=23+24M=24=2^3+2^4M=24=23+24 in two operations.\nExample case 3: N=4N=4N=4 can be converted into M=3=20+21M=3=2^0+2^1M=3=20+21 or M=5=20+22M=5=2^0+2^2M=5=20+22 in one operation.'
