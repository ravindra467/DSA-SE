b'Problem\n\xc2\xa0\n\nYou will be given a tree represented by a matrix. The jth character of ith row will be 1 if there is a path from node i to j.\nYou will also be given two integers N and F. N is the number of nodes in the tree and F(0 based index) is the node to which you need to find the distance from the root node. Root node will always be 0. Print the distance of the node F from the root.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\nFirst line will contain an integer T, the count of test cases. Each test case will start with two space separated integers, N and F, in a newline. N lines will follow each of length N. Each character of these lines will be either 0 or 1.\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\nOutput must contain T lines, each having the distance of the node F from root node 0 for each tree.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 F \xe2\x89\xa4 9\n, F is 0 based index.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n2\n1 0\n0\n9 6\n011000000\n000111000\n000000111\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\nOutput:\n0\n2\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nExample case 1. Since there is only one node which is the root the distance is 0\nExample case 2. Path to node 6 is\n0->2->6, thus distance is 2.'
