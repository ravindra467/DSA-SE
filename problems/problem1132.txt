b'Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.\n\nMike likes strings. He is also interested in algorithms. A few days ago he discovered for himself a very nice problem:\n\n\nYou are given a digit string S. You need to count the number of substrings of S, which are palindromes.\n\n\nDo you know how to solve it? Good. Mike will make the problem a little bit more difficult for you.\n\n\nYou are given a digit string S. You need to count the number of substrings of S, which are palindromes without leading zeros and can be divided by 3 without a remainder.\n\n\nA string is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward. A string is a palindrome without leading zeros if it reads the same backward as forward and doesn\'t start with symbol \'0\'. A string is a digit string, if it doesn\'t contain any symbols except \'0\', \'1\', \'2\', ..., \'9\'.\n\n\nPlease, note that you should consider string "0" as a palindrome without leading zeros.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains a digit string S.\nOutput\nYour output should contain the only integer, denoting the number of substrings of S, which are palindromes without leading zeros and can be divided by 3 without a remainder.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 |S| \xe2\x89\xa4 1 000 000\nExample\nInput:\n1045003\nOutput:\n4\n\nExplanation\n\nIn the example you should count S[2..2] = "0", S[5..5] = "0", S[6..6] = "0" and S[7..7] = "3".\n'
