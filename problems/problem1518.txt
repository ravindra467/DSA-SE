b"Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nTwo players, Askar and Bob, play a game with a token on an undirected graph G. The game goes as follows:\n\nAskar chooses a starting vertex and places the token on this vertex.\nThe players now alternate turns; Bob moves first.\nIn his turn, each player has to move the token along exactly one edge to another vertex.\nIt's not allowed to move the token to some vertex if it was on that vertex earlier during the game (including the starting vertex).\nThe player who can't make a move loses.\n\n \nA vertex v is called a winning vertex if Askar is able to win after choosing this v as the starting vertex. Assume that both players play optimally.\nGiven the graph G, determine how many winning vertices exist.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T - the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers N and M, denoting the number of vertices and the number of edges of G.\nThe following M lines describe the edges of G. Each of these lines contains two integers x and y, denoting an edge between vertices x and y.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the number of winning vertices.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\nN-1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 N(N-1)/2\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 x,y \xe2\x89\xa4 N\nx \xe2\x89\xa0 y\nAll unordered pairs (x,y) will be distinct\nThe graph in each test case will be connected\nSum of M over all test cases in a single file will never exceed 106. \n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (8 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 18\n\n\nSubtask 2 (19 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 40\n\n\nSubtask 3 (26 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 200\n\n\nSubtask 4 (47 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 2000\n\n\nThe time limit is 2 seconds for subtasks 1-3 and 5 seconds for subtask 4.\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n4 6\n1 2\n1 3\n4 1\n4 2\n4 3\n2 3\n8 7\n3 2\n1 2\n4 2\n5 1\n6 3\n7 1\n8 3\n3 2\n1 2\n2 30\n4\n2\nExplanation:\nExample case 1. The graph is a complete graph with 4 vertices, so the game will always last 3 turns; in the 4th turn, Askar will have no way to move and lose.\nExample case 2. If Askar places the token on vertex 7, Bob will have to move it to vertex 1 and Askar can then move it to vertex 5 and win. A similar strategy exists for vertices 5, 6 and 8.\nExample case 3. If Askar places the token on vertex 1, Bob will have to move it to vertex 2 and Askar can then move it to vertex 3 and win. The case when Askar starts at vertex 3 is analogous. On the contrary, if Askar starts at vertex 2, then Bob can move the token to either vertex 1 or 3, and in both cases Askar can't make a move and loses."
