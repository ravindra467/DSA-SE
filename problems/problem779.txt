b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nVivek was quite bored with the lockdown, so he came up with an interesting task. He successfully completed this task and now, he would like you to solve it.\nYou are given two strings AAA and BBB, each with length NNN. Let\'s index the characters in each string from 000 \xe2\x80\x95 for each iii (0\xe2\x89\xa4i<N0 \\le i \\lt N0\xe2\x89\xa4i<N), the i+1i+1i+1-th characters of AAA and BBB are denoted by AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b and BiB_iBi\xe2\x80\x8b respectively. You should convert AAA to BBB by performing operations of the following type:\n\nChoose a subset SSS of the set {0,1,\xe2\x80\xa6,N\xe2\x88\x921}\\{0, 1, \\ldots, N-1\\}{0,1,\xe2\x80\xa6,N\xe2\x88\x921}.\nLet ccc be the alphabetically smallest character among AxA_xAx\xe2\x80\x8b for all x\xe2\x88\x88Sx \\in Sx\xe2\x88\x88S.\nFor each x\xe2\x88\x88Sx \\in Sx\xe2\x88\x88S, replace AxA_xAx\xe2\x80\x8b by ccc.\n\nYou should find the smallest necessary number of operations or report that it is impossible to convert AAA to BBB. If it is possible, you also need to find one way to convert AAA to BBB using this smallest number of operations. If there are multiple solutions, you may find any one.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nThe second line contains a single string AAA.\nThe third line contains a single string BBB.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case:\n\nIf it is impossible to convert AAA to BBB, print a single line containing the integer \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921.\nOtherwise, first, print a line containing a single integer KKK \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum number of operations.\nThen, print KKK lines describing the operations. Each of these lines should contain a positive integer ZZZ, followed by a space and ZZZ pairwise distinct space-separated integers from the set {0,1,\xe2\x80\xa6,N\xe2\x88\x921}\\{0, 1, \\ldots, N-1\\}{0,1,\xe2\x80\xa6,N\xe2\x88\x921} \xe2\x80\x95 the elements of SSS.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4201 \\le T \\le 201\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa420\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\le N \\le 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4103\n\xe2\x88\xa3A\xe2\x88\xa3=\xe2\x88\xa3B\xe2\x88\xa3=N|A| = |B| = N\xe2\x88\xa3A\xe2\x88\xa3=\xe2\x88\xa3B\xe2\x88\xa3=N\nAAA and BBB contain only lowercase English letters\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): BBB contains only characters \'a\' and \'b\'\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n5\nabcab\naabab\n3\naaa\naab\n2\nde\ncd2\n3 1 2 4\n3 0 1 3\n-1\n-1\nExplanation:\nExample case 1:\n\nFirst, we can choose S=(1,2,4)S = (1, 2, 4)S=(1,2,4), so the character ccc is \'b\' and the string AAA after this operation is "abbab".\nThen, we choose S=(0,1,3)S = (0, 1, 3)S=(0,1,3), so ccc is \'a\', and AAA becomes "aabab".\nThere is no way to convert AAA to BBB in only one operation.\n\nExample case 2: We can see that it is impossible to convert AAA to BBB since ccc is always \'a\'.\nExample case 3: We can see again that it is impossible to convert AAA to BBB since ccc cannot be \'c\'.'
