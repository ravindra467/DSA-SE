b'Problem\nFirst yearites are repeatedly asking for fresher\xe2\x80\x99s party to second yearites. But being responsible enough second yearites know that it is not a safe time for parties and they want to avoid overcrowding.\nSo as of now they decided to give every junior a packet of toffees and promised them a party in near future and to which juniors agreed upon.\nSo Utkarsh and Jaskaran(both second yearites) went to a shop to buy toffees for nnn juniors. The shopkeeper has mmm packets of toffees and each packet may contain different number of toffees. To be more specific, first packet contains f1f1f1 number of toffees, the second packet consists of f2f2f2 number of toffees and so on.\nUtkarsh and Jaskaran don\xe2\x80\x99t want to upset juniors. So they decided that difference between the number of toffees in the packets to be as least as possible. Let A1A1A1 be the number of toffees in the largest packet that they buy and A2A2A2 be the number of toffees in the smallest packet they buy. Now they want to buy n packets in such a way that A1\xe2\x88\x92A2A1-A2A1\xe2\x88\x92A2 is minimum possible. \n\nInput\nThe first line contains space-separated integers nnn and mmm . \nThe second line contains mmm space-separated integers f1,\xe2\x80\x89f2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89fmf1,\xe2\x80\x89f2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89fmf1,\xe2\x80\x89f2,\xe2\x80\x89...,\xe2\x80\x89fm  \xe2\x80\x94 the quantities of toffees in the packets sold in the shop.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the least possible difference the teacher can obtain.\n\nConstraints\n2\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa4502 \\leq n,m \\leq 502\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa450\n4\xe2\x89\xa4fi\xe2\x89\xa41034 \\leq fi \\leq 10^34\xe2\x89\xa4fi\xe2\x89\xa4103\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1(10 points):\n2\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa462 \\leq n,m \\leq 62\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa46\nSubtask #2 (90 points):\nOriginal Constraints\n\nSample Input:\n 4 6\n 10 12 10 7 5 22\n\nSample Output:\n 5\n\nExplanation:\n Choose 101010, 101010, 777, 555 as 444 integers. So A1A1A1 will be 101010 and A2A2A2 will be 555. Therefore difference will be 555.'
