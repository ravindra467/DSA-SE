b"Problem\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.\nTonight, Chef would like to hold a party for his NNN friends.\nAll friends are invited and they arrive at the party one by one in an arbitrary order. However, they have certain conditions \xe2\x80\x94 for each valid iii, when the iii-th friend arrives at the party and sees that at that point, strictly less than AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b other people (excluding Chef) have joined the party, this friend leaves the party; otherwise, this friend joins the party.\nHelp Chef estimate how successful the party can be \xe2\x80\x94 find the maximum number of his friends who could join the party (for an optimal choice of the order of arrivals).\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum number of Chef's friends who could join the party.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le T \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le N \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 10610^6106\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n2\n0 0\n6\n3 1 0 0 5 5\n3\n1 2 32\n4\n0\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: Chef has two friends. Both of them do not require anyone else to be at the party before they join, so they will both definitely join the party.\nExample case 2: At the beginning, friends 333 and 444 can arrive and join the party, since they do not require anyone else to be at the party before they join. After that, friend 222 can arrive; this friend would see that there are two people at the party and therefore also join. Then, friend 111 will also join, so in the end, there would be 444 people attending the party.\nExample case 3: No one will attend the party because each of Chef's friends will find zero people at the party and leave, regardless of the order in which they arrive."
