b'Problem\nRead problems statements Hindi ,Bengali , Mandarin chinese , Russian and Vietnamese as well.\n.\nChef offers delicious food in his restaurant, but he wants to make it a more attractive place too.\nThe guests in the restaurant usually walk along a path consisting of two adjacent, parallel rows of square bricks leading to the entrance. Each row is NNN bricks long, all bricks have the same size and there are no holes.\nUnfortunately, the path looks pretty boring because all bricks have the same color. In order to make it more interesting, Chef wants to replace exactly KKK bricks by more beautiful ones in such a way that no two replaced bricks share a side.\nChef asks you to answer a question that is too complicated for him: in how many ways can Chef select the bricks to replace? Since the answer can be very large, compute it modulo 109+710^9 + 7109+7.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and KKK.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of ways to replace bricks, modulo 109+710^9 + 7109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa451 \\le T \\le 51\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\le N \\le 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le K \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n\nSubtasks:\nSubtask #1 (25 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le N \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nSubtask #2 (75 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n3 28\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: There are exactly 888 valid ways to choose the positions of K=2K = 2K=2 beautiful bricks.'
