b'Problem\nChef is very popular in UnderBelly. He is known for his talent of making a dish worst or best by changing the ingredients. Once a programmer visits UnderBelly, and he got to know about the chef\xe2\x80\x99s talent. The Programmer decided to test the chef. You are the chef, and you have to prove yourself by solving this problem.\nGiven an array of integers, you can change at most KKK number of elements by inverting any bit of a number at most one time (including zero). Such that\n\nwhen NNN is even the resulting array is lexicographically maximum.\nelse when NNN is odd the resulting array is lexicographically minimum.\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers - N,KN, KN,K respectively.\nThe second line of each test case contains NNN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN respectively.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, print a single line containing NNN space-separated integers \xe2\x80\x95 the changed array.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\leq T \\leq 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\leq K \\leq N \\leq 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq Ai \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i\n\nSample Input:\n    4\r\n    6 1\r\n    1 2 3 4 5 6\r\n    8 2\r\n    8 7 15 31 16 14 18 48\r\n    3 3\r\n    12 22 32\r\n    5 5\r\n    1 2 3 4 5\n\nSample Output:\n1 3 3 4 5 6\r\n12 7 15 31 24 14 18 48\r\n4 6 0\r\n0 0 1 0 1\r\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nExample case 1:\r\nThe array can be changed to make it lexicographically maximum by inverting the LSB bit of 222.\nExample case 2:\r\nThe array can be changed to make it lexicographically maximum by inverting a bit of 888 and 161616 to make them 121212 and 242424 respectively.\n$8  \xe2\x86\x92 1000$\t      \t$16 \xe2\x86\x92 10000$\r\n$12 \xe2\x86\x92 1100$\t\t$24 \xe2\x86\x92 11000$\n'
