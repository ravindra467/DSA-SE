b'Problem\nMausil is a real estate agent, belonging to Pajal. He has a plan to build a series of MMM buildings in Pajal and for this he found a land which can accommodate MMM buildings in a row one after another. The rule of the Pajal government is that no building in Pajal can have more than NNN floors. Based on a few factors like cost of the land, water resources etc. the cost of constructing a building is not the same in all pieces of land and it also depends on the number of floors you want to have in that building.\nA community is a maximal group of buildings which have the same number of floors. For example: buildingsbuildingsbuildings = [1,1,1,2,2,1,3,3,3][1,1,1,2,2,1,3,3,3][1,1,1,2,2,1,3,3,3] has 4 communities - {(1,1,1),(2,2),(1),(3,3,3)}\\{(1,1,1),(2,2),(1),(3,3,3)\\}{(1,1,1),(2,2),(1),(3,3,3)}. Mausil wants to have exactly KKK communities in this project.\nBut in this land few buildings were already constructed. Mausil doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to collapse them. He wants to leave all the buildings which were already constructed as they are and construct buildings in the empty pieces of land.\nSo given an array buildingsbuildingsbuildings, an M\xc3\x97NM \\times NM\xc3\x97N matrix costcostcost and an integer KKK where:\n\nbuildings[i]buildings[i]buildings[i] denotes the number of floors that ithi^{th}ith building has if it is positive and if it is 000, it denotes an empty piece of land in which a building has to be constructed.\ncost[i][j]cost[i][j]cost[i][j] denotes the cost of constructing a building in ithi^{th}ith piece of land with jjj floors.\n\nIf CCC denotes the minimum total cost required for constructing all the buildings in empty pieces of land such that there are exactly KKK communities. You are definitely smarter than Mausil, so please help Mausil to find CCC. If it is not possible to have exactly KKK communities return \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921.\nInput:\n\nThe first line of input has a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases.\nFirst line of each test case has 333 space separated integers M,NM,NM,N and KKK.\nSecond line of each test case has MMM space separated integers denoting the Buildings array.\nThe following MMM lines for each test case have NNN space separated integers in each line, denoting the M\xc3\x97NM \\times NM\xc3\x97N cost matrix of that test case.\n\nOutput:\n\nFor each test case print a single integer CCC if it is possible to have KKK communities, else print \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq K \\leq M \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4201 \\leq N \\leq 201\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa420\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Buildings[i]\xe2\x89\xa4N0 \\leq Buildings[i]  \\leq N0\xe2\x89\xa4Buildings[i]\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Cost[i][j]\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\leq Cost[i][j] \\leq 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4Cost[i][j]\xe2\x89\xa4104\n\nSample Input:\n5 2 3\r\n0 2 1 2 0\r\n1 10\r\n10 1\r\n10 1\r\n1 10\r\n5 1\n\nSample Output:\n11\n\nExplanation:\nThree buildings were already constructed, if we construct the remaining houses in optimal way the resultant Buildings array would be [2,2,1,2,2][2,2,1,2,2][2,2,1,2,2]. This land has 333 communities, (2,2),(1),(2,2){(2,2),(1),(2,2)}(2,2),(1),(2,2). The cost of construction here is Cost[1][2]+Cost[5][2]=10+1=11Cost[1][2]+Cost[5][2]=10+1 = 11Cost[1][2]+Cost[5][2]=10+1=11(considering 1-based indexing).'
