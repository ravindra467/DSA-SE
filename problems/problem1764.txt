b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nRoger recently built a circular race track with length KKK. After hosting a few races, he realised that people do not come there to see the race itself, they come to see racers crash into each other (what\'s wrong with our generation...). After this realisation, Roger decided to hold a different kind of "races": he hired NNN racers (numbered 111 through NNN) whose task is to crash into each other.\nAt the beginning, for each valid iii, the iii-th racer is XiX_iXi\xe2\x80\x8b metres away from the starting point of the track (measured in the clockwise direction) and driving in the direction DiD_iDi\xe2\x80\x8b (clockwise or counterclockwise). All racers move with the constant speed 111 metre per second. The lengths of cars are negligible, but the track is only wide enough for one car, so whenever two cars have the same position along the track, they crash into each other and the direction of movement of each of these cars changes (from clockwise to counterclockwise and vice versa). The cars do not change the directions of their movement otherwise.\nSince crashes reduce the lifetime of the racing cars, Roger sometimes wonders how many crashes happen. You should answer QQQ queries. In each query, you are given an integer TTT and you should find the number of crashes that happen until TTT seconds have passed (inclusive).\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers NNN, QQQ and KKK.\nNNN lines follow. For each iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le i \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the iii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers DiD_iDi\xe2\x80\x8b and XiX_iXi\xe2\x80\x8b, where Di=1D_i = 1Di\xe2\x80\x8b=1 and Di=2D_i = 2Di\xe2\x80\x8b=2 denote the clockwise and counterclockwise directions respectively.\nEach of the next QQQ lines contain a single integer TTT describing a query.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of crashes.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le N \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le Q \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa410121 \\le K \\le 10^{12}1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41012\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Di\xe2\x89\xa421 \\le D_i \\le 21\xe2\x89\xa4Di\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa42 for each valid iii\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Xi\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x88\x9210 \\le X_i \\le K - 10\xe2\x89\xa4Xi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x88\x921 for each valid iii\nX1,X2,\xe2\x80\xa6,XNX_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_NX1\xe2\x80\x8b,X2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,XN\xe2\x80\x8b are pairwise distinct\n0\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410120 \\le T \\le 10^{12}0\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41012\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput5 3 11\n1 3\n1 10\n2 4\n2 7\n2 0\n3\n8\n1004\n10\n110'
