b'Problem\nWith this jump, you move further in time and land inside the NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration]. The ways of time are completely bizarre. You hear the same laugh which pushed you in this machine and you turn to find the mad scientist, Prof Paradox. He laughs telling you that you have entered doomsday and that the whole Homosapien species ends that day. Though shocked you are determined to stop this, whatever it might be.\nProf Paradox is a part of the Asteroid Impact Avoidance Committee [AIAC] in NASA and he informs you that NNN asteroids, with varying sizes, are approaching Earth and if left unattended, it will end life on Earth as we know it. Fortunately you have KKK nuclear plasma blasters that can destroy an asteroid. The cost of each blast is determined by the size of the asteroid. However, after each blast, the cost required increases.\nIf xxx is the number of blasts already fired by a blaster BiBiBi, then the cost of the next blast in the blaster BiBiBi is (x+1)\xe2\x88\x97S(x+1)*S(x+1)\xe2\x88\x97S where SSS is the size of the asteroid. You are free to use any number of the available KKK blasters.\nCan you avoid this collision course by finding the minimum cost required to save our planet?\r\nSince the results can be large, output result modulo 1000000007 (109+710^9 + 7109+7).\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nFirst line of each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers N,KN, KN,K.\nSecond line of each testcase contains NNN spaced integers denoting the size of the asteroid.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line the minimum cost required to destroy all the asteroids modulo 1000000007.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4501 \\leq T \\leq 501\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa450\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000001 \\leq N \\leq 1000001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq K \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4SizeofeachAsteroid\xe2\x89\xa410000001 \\leq Size of each Asteroid \\leq 10000001\xe2\x89\xa4SizeofeachAsteroid\xe2\x89\xa41000000\n\nSubtasks\n\n25 points : 1\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq N,K \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa4100\n75 points : original constraints\n\nSample Input:\n2\r\n5 3\r\n4 2 5 3 9\t\r\n3 3\r\n2 5 6\n\nSample Output :\n28\r\n13\n\nEXPLANATION 1:\nWe have 333 plasma blasters,\n1st1st1st and 2nd2nd2nd asteroid can be shot by blaster 111:\r\nCost=(4\xe2\x88\x9714*14\xe2\x88\x971)+(2\xe2\x88\x9722*22\xe2\x88\x972)=888\n3rd3rd3rd and 4th4th4th asteroid can be shot by blaster 222:\r\nCost=(5\xe2\x88\x9715*15\xe2\x88\x971)+(3\xe2\x88\x9723*23\xe2\x88\x972)=111111\n5th5th5th asteroid can be shot by blaster 333:\r\nCost=(9\xe2\x88\x9719*19\xe2\x88\x971)=999\nTherefore, Total Cost = 8+11+98+11+98+11+9 = 282828.\r\nIt can be verified that any other possible combination results in a larger cost.'
