b'Problem\nRecently a renowned scientist, Chef discovered a planet. Total trees on planet are NNN and are denoted by XXX and YYY coordinates.\nChef defined strength of a tree of the planet as the number of distinct subsets of remaining trees whose convex hull can enclose the tree completely and strictly inside it. More formally, let S(x)S(x)S(x) be strength of tree xxx, AAA be any subset of given N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 trees (excluding the tree xxx from NNN trees) and HHH be the convex hull of AAA. Then,\nS(x)S(x)S(x) === Total number of subsets AAA for which HHH contains tree xxx strictly inside it.\nSum of strengths of all trees is assumed to be the total strength of the planet. Chef has already calculated total strength of the planet, now he wants you to calculate the total strength just for verification. Chef knows that the total strength can be high so he wants you to calculate the total strength modulo 10910^9109 +++ 777.\nNotes:Notes:Notes:\n111. Consider the planet as a very large 222-Dimensional Plane.\n222. All Trees have distinct coordinates and no three trees are collinear.\nInput Format:\n\n1st1^{st}1st line contains NNN which denotes number of trees.\nFollowing NNN lines contains two integer XXX and YYY denoting the coordinates of ithi^{th}ith tree.\n\nOutput Format:\n\nA single integer denoting the summation of all S(x)S(x)S(x) modulo 10910^9109 +++ 777.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq N \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000\n\xe2\x88\x921000000\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa41000000-1000000 \\leq x,y \\leq 1000000\xe2\x88\x921000000\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa41000000\n\nSample Input:\n5\n0 0\n0 2\n4 2\n4 0\n1 1\nSample Output:\n3\nExplanation:\nLet A(0,0)A(0,0)A(0,0), B(0,2)B(0,2)B(0,2), C(4,0)C(4,0)C(4,0), D(4,2)D(4,2)D(4,2) and E(1,1)E(1,1)E(1,1). Subset ABCDABCDABCD contains point EEE inside. Subset ABCABCABC contains point EEE inside. Subset ABDABDABD contains point EEE inside it. Rest all other subsets do not contains any point inside them. Therefore, summation of S(x)S(x)S(x) === 333.'
