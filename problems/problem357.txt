b'Problem\n\nMunchi and BlackHammer like to play games. BlackHammer gives Munchi 2 numbers N and M and allowes him to perform following operations on the numbers-\n\nSubtract 1 from any one of the numbers.\nDivide both the numbers by their gcd.\n\n\n\nNow, Munchi wants to know the minimum number of operations to convert (N,M) to (1,1).\n\nInput\n\nFirst line contains T - Number of test cases.\nNext T lines contain 2 integers N, M\n\nOutput\nMinimum operations to convert both N and M to 1.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4500\n\nExample\n\nSample Input\n1\n8 4\n\n\nSample Output\n2\n\n\nExplaination\n-Operation 2: N=2 M=1\n-Operation 1(on N): N=1 M=1\n'
