b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nYou are given two strings SSS and RRR. Each of these strings has length NNN. We want to make SSS equal to RRR by performing the following operation some number of times (possibly zero):\n\nChoose two integers aaa and bbb such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4a\xe2\x89\xa4b\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le a \\le b \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4a\xe2\x89\xa4b\xe2\x89\xa4N.\nFor each iii such that a\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4ba \\le i \\le ba\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4b, replace the iii-th character of SSS by the iii-th character of RRR.\n\nSuppose that we make SSS equal to RRR by performing this operation kkk times, in such a way that the total number of replaced characters (i.e. the sum of all kkk values of b\xe2\x88\x92a+1b-a+1b\xe2\x88\x92a+1) is lll. Then, the cost of this process is defined as k\xe2\x8b\x85lk \\cdot lk\xe2\x8b\x85l.\nFind the minimum cost with which we can make SSS equal to RRR.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single string SSS.\nThe second line contains a single string RRR.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum cost.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa44,0001 \\le T \\le 4,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa44,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\le N \\le 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\n\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3=\xe2\x88\xa3R\xe2\x88\xa3=N|S| = |R| = N\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3=\xe2\x88\xa3R\xe2\x88\xa3=N\nSSS and RRR contain only lowercase English letters\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851062 \\cdot 10^62\xe2\x8b\x85106\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\nadefb\nbdefa4\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: SSS can be made equal to RRR in two moves. First, we replace S1S_1S1\xe2\x80\x8b by R1R_1R1\xe2\x80\x8b and then replace S5S_5S5\xe2\x80\x8b by R5R_5R5\xe2\x80\x8b. We have k=l=2k = l = 2k=l=2, so the cost is 2\xe2\x8b\x852=42 \\cdot 2 = 42\xe2\x8b\x852=4. If we wanted to perform only one operation, the cost would be 555.'
