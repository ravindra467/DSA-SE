b"Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  , Russian and Vietnamese\n\nThere are n chef's in Chefland. There is a festival in Chefland in which each chef is asked to vote a person as his best friend. Obviously, a person can't vote himself as his best friend.  Note that the best friend relationship is not necessarily bi-directional, i.e. it might be possible that x is best friend of y, but y is not a best friend of x.\n\n\nDevu was the election commissioner who conducted this voting. Unfortunately, he was sleeping during the voting time. So, he could not see the actual vote of each person, instead after the voting, he counted the number of votes of each person and found that number of votes of i-th person was equal to ci. \n\n\nNow he is wondering whether this distribution of votes corresponds to some actual voting or some fraudulent voting has happened. If the current distribution of votes does not correspond to any real voting, print -1. Otherwise, print any one of the possible voting which might have lead to the current distribution. If there are more than one possible ways of voting leading to the current distribution, you can print any one of them.\n\nInput\n\nFirst line of the input contains a single integer T denoting number of test cases.\nFirst line of each test case, contains a single integer n.\nSecond line of each test case, contains n space separated integers denoting array c.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case,\n\nIf there is no real voting corresponding to given distribution of votes, print -1 in a single line.\nOtherwise, print n space separated integers denoting a possible voting leading to current distribution of votes. i-th integer should denote the index of the person (1 based indexing) whom i-th person has voted as his best friend.\n\nConstraints and Subtasks\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 500\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 50\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 ci \xe2\x89\xa4 n\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n3\n1 1 1\n3\n3 0 0\n3\n2 2 0\nOutput:\n2 3 1\n-1\n-1\n\nExplanation\n\nExample 1: In this example, each person has received one vote. One possible example of real voting leading to this distribution is {2, 3, 1}. In this distribution, number of votes of all three persons are equal to 1. Also it is real voting because no person votes himself as his best friend. \nYou can also output another possible distribution {3, 1, 2} too.\n\n\nExample 2: There is no real voting  corresponding to this voting distribution.\n\n\nExample 3: There is no real voting  corresponding to this voting distribution.\n"
