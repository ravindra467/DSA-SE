b"Problem\nYou have a tree of NNN vertices rooted at vertex 111, where NNN is even. The iii-th vertex has a binary value AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b written on it (i.e, each AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b is either 000 or 111).\nA tree is said to be balanced if and only if the number of zeros written on its vertices equals the number of ones written on its vertices.\nYou can select some disjoint subtrees and flip the values on them (i.e, make all 0's into 1's and all 1's into 0's). Formally, you can pick any subset (possibly empty) of vertices {v1,v2,\xe2\x80\xa6,vk}\\{v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_k\\}{v1\xe2\x80\x8b,v2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,vk\xe2\x80\x8b} such that viv_ivi\xe2\x80\x8b is not an ancestor of vjv_jvj\xe2\x80\x8b for i\xe2\x89\xa0ji \\neq ji\xee\x80\xa0=j, and flip the value of AxA_xAx\xe2\x80\x8b for every vertex xxx that is contained in the subtree of some viv_ivi\xe2\x80\x8b.\nFind a way of performing this operation that makes the entire tree balanced. It can be proved that the solution always exists.\nIf there are multiple possible solutions, you may print any of them. In particular, you do not need to minimize the number of subtrees that are flipped.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer TTT, the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer NNN \xe2\x80\x94 the size of the tree.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x94 the values on the vertices.\nThen, N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 lines follow. The iii-th line contains two space-separated integers uiu_iui\xe2\x80\x8b and viv_ivi\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x94 the vertices connected by the iii-th edge.\n\nOutput Format\n\nFor each test case, first print a single integer mmm \xe2\x80\x94 the number of operations you performed.\nThen, on the second line, print mmm space-separated integers \xe2\x80\x94 the roots of the subtrees you decided to flip.\nIf there are multiple solutions, you can print any of them.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa430001 \\leq T \\leq 30001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa43000\nThe sum of NNN across all test cases doesn't exceed  3\xe2\x8b\x851053 \\cdot 10^53\xe2\x8b\x85105\nNNN is even\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa410 \\leq A_i \\leq 10\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa41\n\n\nSubtasks\n\n\nSubtask 1 (10 points):\n\nThe iii-th edge connects vertices iii and i+1i+1i+1.\n\n\nSubtask 2 (25 points):\n\nSum of NNN across all test cases doesn't exceed 500500500.\n\n\nSubtask 3 (30 points):\n\nAi=1A_i = 1Ai\xe2\x80\x8b=1 for 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq i \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N.\n\n\nSubtask 4 (35 points):\n\nNo further constraints.\n\n\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n4\n0 1 0 0\n1 2\n1 3\n3 4\n4\n1 1 1 1\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n1\n4 \n2\n3 4 \n\nExplanation:\nTest case 111: The values A1,A2,A3,A4A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4A1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,A3\xe2\x80\x8b,A4\xe2\x80\x8b become [0,1,0,1][0, 1, 0, 1][0,1,0,1] after the flip.
