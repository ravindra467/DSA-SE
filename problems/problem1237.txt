b"Problem\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nThere are N minions who are competing in an election of the president of the ACM (Association of Cute Minions). They are standing in a line in the order from minion 1 to minion N. For each i (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 N), the i-th minion has an influence level of Si.\nA single minion may cast any number of votes. Minion j will vote for minion i (i \xe2\x89\xa0 j) if and only if the influence level of the j-th minion is greater than or equal to the sum of influence levels of all the minions standing between them (excluding the i-th and j-th minion).\nYour task is to find the number of votes received by each minion.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of minions.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers S1, S2, ..., SN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers. For each valid i, the i-th of these integers should denote the number of votes the i-th minion will get.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Si \xe2\x89\xa4 109 for each valid i\nsum of N over all test cases won't exceed 106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points):\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 500\nsum of N over all test cases won't exceed 10,000\n\n\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n4\n4 3 2 1\n5\n1 2 2 3 11 2 3 2\n2 3 2 3 1\nExplanation:\nExample case 1:\n\nThe first minion will get only a vote of the second minion.\nThe second minion will get votes of the first and third minion.\nThe third minion will get votes of the first, second and fourth minion.\nThe fourth minion will get votes of the second and third minion.\n\n"
