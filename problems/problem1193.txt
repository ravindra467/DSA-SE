b"Problem\nThere is a marketmarketmarket in ChefLandChef LandChefLand with NNN shops, marked from integers 000 to 999. Now, some of these shops (0 or more) from the endendend of the market were cyclic shifted  or in other words moved from the  endendend to the beginningbeginningbeginning of the market without  changing the internal arrangement of the shops in the market.\nFor two arrangement of the same length AAA and BBB, let's say AAA is a cyclic shift of BBB if it is possible to make AAA equals to BBB by moving 0 or more last elements to the beginning of the arrangement without changing the internal order.\nYou are given initial arrangement of shops in the market and the modified arrangement of shops. You have to tell if the modified arrangement of shops is cyclic shifted or not.\r\nIf modified arrangement is properly cyclic shifted it is good arrangement else it is bad arrangement.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nEach testcase contains of three  line of input.\nFirst line contains NNN ,the number of shops present in the market.\nSecond line contains integers A1,A2......ANA_1,A_2. ..... A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b......AN\xe2\x80\x8b, representing the initial  arrangement of shops  in the market.\nThird line contains integers B1,B2......BNB_1,B_2......B_NB1\xe2\x80\x8b,B2\xe2\x80\x8b......BN\xe2\x80\x8b, representing the modified arrangement of shops in the market.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output GOODGOODGOOD if modified arrangement is good and BADBADBAD if modified arrangement is bad.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq T \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\leq N \\leq 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4104\nThe sum of  A[i]A[i]A[i]  and  B[i]B[i]B[i]  doesn't exceeds 10410^4104 over all testcases.\n\nSample Input:\n2\n10\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n6\n0 1 3 4 5 6\n1 5 6 3 4 0\nSample Output:\nGOOD\nBAD\nEXPLANATION:\nPick 888 and 999  labelled shops from the last of market [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9][0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9][0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] and  move to   start of the market that give [8,9,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7][8, 9 ,0,1 ,2, 3 ,4 ,5, 6 ,7][8,9,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7] as good modified arrangement.\r\nHence answer is GOODGOODGOOD.\nIn second case the internal order of shops  in the modified arrangement was not maintained\r\nHence answer is BADBADBAD."
