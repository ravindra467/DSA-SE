b'Problem\nAn input string SSS of length NNN is transferred through the network using a special protocol. The protocol can send the string through a series of operations. In one operation, we can choose a lowercase english alphabet CCC and do one of the following:\n\nTransfer 111 copy of CCC through the network.\nTransfer 222 copies of CCC through the network.\n\nEach of the above transfers take 111 unit of time.\nFind the minimum time in which we can transfer the entire string SSS through the network.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line will contain TTT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nFirst line of each test case contains NNN - the length of the string SSS.\nSecond line of each test case contains the string SSS.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output in a single line, the minimum time required to transfer the string.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq T \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nSum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 10510^5105.\nString SSS contains lowercase english alphabets only.\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n5\ncbcdc\n6\naabeee\n5\n4\n\nExplanation:\nTest Case 111: String can be transferred through following operations: send 111 copy of character c\\texttt{c}c, send 111 copy of character b\\texttt{b}b, send 111 copy of character c\\texttt{c}c, send 111 copy of character d\\texttt{d}d, and send 111 copy of character c\\texttt{c}c. Thus, total 555 operations are required.\nTest Case 222: String can be transferred through following operations: send 222 copies of character a\\texttt{a}a, send 111 copy of character b\\texttt{b}b, send 111 copy of character e\\texttt{e}e, and send 222 copies of character e\\texttt{e}e. Thus, total 444 operations are required.'
