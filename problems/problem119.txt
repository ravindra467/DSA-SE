b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Mandarin Chinese and Bengali.\nLet\'s define Fibonacci concatenation sequence as follows:\n\n\nf[0]=0f[0] = 0f[0]=0, f[1]=1f[1] = 1f[1]=1\n\n\nf[i]=f[i\xe2\x88\x921]+f[i\xe2\x88\x922]f[i] = f[i-1] + f[i-2]f[i]=f[i\xe2\x88\x921]+f[i\xe2\x88\x922], for every i\xe2\x89\xa52i \\geq 2i\xe2\x89\xa52\n\n\nHere f[i]f[i]f[i] denotes the ithi^{th}ith Fibonacci concatenation number and +++ represents concatenation.\nFor example, f[2]=f[1]+f[0]=1+0=10f[2] = f[1] + f[0] = 1 + 0 = 10f[2]=f[1]+f[0]=1+0=10, f[3]=f[2]+f[1]=f[3] = f[2] + f[1] =f[3]=f[2]+f[1]= 10+1=10 + 1 = 10+1= 101101101.\nGiven an integer nnn, you have to determine the sum of digits of all subsequences of the nthn^{th}nth Fibonacci concatenation number f[n]f[n]f[n],  modulo 109+710^9 + 7109+7.\nA subsequence of a number is a sequence of digits that can be derived from the number by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) digits without changing the order of the remaining digits. The subsequence may even start with trailing zeros. For example 101010, 010101 are subsequences of 101101101 while 110110110 is NOT a subsequence of 101101101. Note that there are 888 subsequences of 101101101. The subsequence 111 appears twice and should be counted as different while computing the sum.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single integer nnn.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the sum of digits of all subsequences of f[n]f[n]f[n], modulo 109+710^9 + 7109+7.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq T \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq n \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n1\n2\n3\n1\n2\n8\n\nExplanation:\nTest case 111: Since f[1]=1f[1]=1f[1]=1, we have only two subsequences, "" (empty subsequence) and "111". So the sum of digits of both subsequences is 0+1=1 0 + 1 = 10+1=1.\nTest case 222: Since f[2]=10f[2] = 10f[2]=10, we have four subsequences, "" (empty subsequence), "111", "000" and "101010". So the sum of digits of all the subsequences is 0+1+0+1=20 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 20+1+0+1=2.'
