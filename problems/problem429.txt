b"Problem\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian  and Vietnamese as well.\nNazik gave Batman a tree with NNN vertices (numbered 111 through NNN). There are some robbers in the tree; of course, Batman wants to catch the robbers.\nInitially, Batman is in a vertex sss and his power is equal to ppp. During each of the next MMM seconds, the following process happens:\n\nA robber with power rrr runs from a vertex xxx straight to vertex yyy.\nBatman either catches the robber or stays in his current vertex (and never catches this robber).\nBatman can only catch the robber if Batman's power is strictly greater than the robber's power.\nLet's denote Batman's current vertex by sss (s=sis=s_is=si\xe2\x80\x8b initially). To catch the robber, Batman must choose a vertex ggg such that each vertex on the simple path between xxx and yyy (inclusive) lies also on the simple path between sss and ggg (inclusive). If it is impossible to choose a vertex ggg so that this condition is satisfied, Batman cannot catch this robber.\nIf Batman catches the robber, ggg becomes his current vertex.\nAfter Batman catches this robber, his power increases by ttt.\n\nYour task is to calculate the maximum power Batman can have after MMM seconds if he chooses the robbers to catch optimally.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NNN, sis_isi\xe2\x80\x8b and ppp.\nEach of the next N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two space-separated integers uuu and vvv denoting an edge in the tree between vertices uuu and vvv.\nThe next line contains a single integer MMM.\nEach of the following MMM lines contains four integers xxx, yyy, rrr and ttt describing a robber.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum possible value of Batman's power after MMM seconds.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le T \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa44\xe2\x8b\x851051 \\le N, M \\le 4\\cdot10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa44\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4si,u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le s_i, u, v \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4si\xe2\x80\x8b,u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\nthe graph described on the input is a tree\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le x, y \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4N\nx\xe2\x89\xa0yx \\neq yx\xee\x80\xa0=y\n1\xe2\x89\xa4p,r\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\le p, r \\le 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4p,r\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\xe2\x88\xa3t\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4109|t| \\le 10^9\xe2\x88\xa3t\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4109\nthe sum of NNN for all test cases does not exceed 4\xe2\x8b\x851054\\cdot10^54\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of MMM for all test cases does not exceed 4\xe2\x8b\x851054\\cdot10^54\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n6 1 4\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n4 5\n1 6\n5\n6 4 3 8\n1 2 3 2\n4 6 5 -1\n6 5 4 6\n5 4 5 -312\nExplanation:\nExample case 1:\n\nIn the 2-nd second, Batman will go from vertex s=1s=1s=1 to vertex g=5g=5g=5.\nIn the 4-th second, Batman will go from vertex s=5s=5s=5 to vertex g=6g=6g=6.\nBatman should ignore robbers moving in the 1-st, 3-rd and 5-th second.\n"
