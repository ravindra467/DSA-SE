b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has been studying the human sleep cycle for years. He divides a day into LLL units of time (numbered 111 through LLL). Chef\'s research shows that his body requires spending only HHH continuous units of time per day on sleep \xe2\x80\x94 then, he can stay active during work. However, in case of travel or any other responsibilities, he might not be able to achieve this ideal state.\nNext, Chef noticed that if he sleeps for xxx (x<Hx \\lt Hx<H) continuous units of time and then performs some other activity, he can still meet his daily sleep quota, but the remaining time he needs to spend on continuously sleeping becomes 2\xe2\x8b\x85(H\xe2\x88\x92x)2\\cdot(H-x)2\xe2\x8b\x85(H\xe2\x88\x92x). He can further split this sleeping time in the same way, i.e. if he now sleeps for yyy more (y<2\xe2\x8b\x85(H\xe2\x88\x92x)y \\lt 2\\cdot(H-x)y<2\xe2\x8b\x85(H\xe2\x88\x92x)) continuous units of time, his required sleeping time becomes 2\xe2\x8b\x85(2\xe2\x8b\x85(H\xe2\x88\x92x)\xe2\x88\x92y)2\\cdot(2\\cdot(H-x)-y)2\xe2\x8b\x85(2\xe2\x8b\x85(H\xe2\x88\x92x)\xe2\x88\x92y), and so on.\nYou are given a string SSS with length LLL; for each valid iii, the iii-th character of this string is \'0\' if the iii-th unit of time is free (so Chef can use it to sleep) or \'1\' if it is occupied.\nCan Chef ever get enough sleep to feel fresh during his work, given that he can choose when to sleep in his free time?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers LLL and HHH.\nThe second line contains a single string SSS with length LLL.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single line containing the string "YES" if Chef can have the required amount of sleep or "NO" if he cannot (without quotes).\nYou may print each character of each string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will all be treated as identical).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq T \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4H\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq H \\leq L \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4H\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4105\nSSS contains only characters \'0\' and \'1\'\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4\n3 1\n111\n3 1\n101\n7 5\n0000100\n6 5\n000010NO\nYES\nYES\nNO\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: Chef needs only 111 unit of sleep, but since he is busy all the time, he cannot sleep at all.\nExample case 2: Chef needs only 111 unit of sleep and he has exactly one unit of time when he is free, so he can sleep during that unit of time.\nExample case 3: Chef needs 555 continuous units of sleep. First, he spends the first 444 free units of time, and then he needs 2\xe2\x8b\x85(5\xe2\x88\x924)=22 \\cdot (5 - 4) = 22\xe2\x8b\x85(5\xe2\x88\x924)=2 continuous units of sleep, which he has available as the last 222 free units of time.\nExample case 4: Chef needs 555 units of sleep. If he spends the first 444 units of time, he still needs 2\xe2\x8b\x85(5\xe2\x88\x924)=22 \\cdot (5 - 4) = 22\xe2\x8b\x85(5\xe2\x88\x924)=2 continuous units of sleep, but only a single unit of time is left now, so he is unable to get enough sleep.'
