b'Problem\nBob just learned about bitwise operators. Since Alice is an expert, she decided to play a game, she will give a number xxx to Bob and will ask some questions:\nThere will be 4 different kinds of queries:-\n\n\nAlice gives an integer iii and Bob has to report the status of the ithi^{th}ith bit in xxx, the answer is "ON""ON""ON" if it is on else "OFF""OFF""OFF".\n\n\nAlice gives an integer iii and Bob has to turn on the ithi^{th}ith bit in xxx.\n\n\nAlice gives an integer iii and Bob has to turn off the ithi^{th}ith bit in xxx.\n\n\nAlice gives two integers ppp and qqq and in the binary representation of xxx Bob has to swap the pthp^{th}pth and the qthq^{th}qth bits.\n\n\nThe value of xxx changes after any update operation.\npositions iii, ppp, and qqq are always counted from the right or from the least significant bit.\nIf anyone of iii, ppp, or qqq is greater than the number of bits in the binary representation of xxx, consider 000 at that position.\nInput:\n\nFirst-line will contain TTT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nthe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x,Qx, Qx,Q.\n2Q2Q2Q lines follow.\nfirst line is an integer, the query type.\nfor each query of type 1 to 3, there will be the integer iii\nfor the query of type 4, there will be two space-separated integers, the integers p,qp, qp,q\n\nOutput:\nFor the queries of the first kind, print "ON""ON""ON" or "OFF""OFF""OFF".\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\leq T \\leq 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq x \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\leq Q \\leq 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4i,p,q\xe2\x89\xa4301 \\leq i,p,q \\leq 301\xe2\x89\xa4i,p,q\xe2\x89\xa430\n\nSample Input\n\t1\r\n\t2 2\r\n\t2 \r\n\t1\r\n\t1 \r\n\t1\n\nSample Output:\n\tON\n\nEXPLANATION:\nthe binary representation of 2 is 10\r\nfor query 1, we just have to update x to 11 (or 3 in decimal).\r\nfor the next query, x is now 3 or 11 in binary so the answer is ON.\n'
