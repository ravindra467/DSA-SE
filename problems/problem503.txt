b"Problem\nFor a table in a restaurant which divided by n x m cells, the waiter has randomly placed Ice-cream and gulab jamun on each cell of the table. Find out the largest rectangle which can be formed by Ice-creams only such that there is no gulab jamun within the rectangle.\nNote: Ice-cream is represented by char values as '1' and gulab jamun by '0'. The input is given in the form of n x m Matrix containing zeros and ones.\nInput Format\n\nFirst line has two space separated integers n,mn, mn,m which form the nxm matrix.\nNext nnn lines represents the space separated mmm elements as char values \xe2\x80\xb21\xe2\x80\xb2'1'\xe2\x80\xb21\xe2\x80\xb2 or \xe2\x80\xb20\xe2\x80\xb2'0'\xe2\x80\xb20\xe2\x80\xb2.\n\nOutput Format\noutput is the resulting area in integer.\nConstraints\n\n1 <= n, m  <= 200\nmatrix[i][j] is 0 or 1.\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4 5\n1 0 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 0 0 1 08\n\nSample 2:\nInputOutput1 0\n0\n0\n"
