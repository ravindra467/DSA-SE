b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nElections are coming soon. This year, two candidates passed to the final stage. One candidate is John Jackson and his opponent is Jack Johnson.\nDuring the elections, everyone can vote for their favourite candidate, but no one can vote for both candidates. Then, packs of votes which went to the same candidate are formed. You know that for John Jackson, there are NNN packs containing A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b votes, and for Jack Johnson, there are MMM packs containing B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BMB_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_MB1\xe2\x80\x8b,B2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,BM\xe2\x80\x8b votes.\nThe winner is the candidate that has strictly more votes than the other candidate; if both have the same number of votes, there is no winner. You are a friend of John Jackson and you want to help him win. To do that, you may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero): choose two packs of votes that currently belong to different candidates and swap them, i.e. change the votes in each of these packs so that they would go to the other candidate.\nYou are very careful, so you want to perform as few swaps as possible. Find the smallest number of operations you need to perform or determine that it is impossible to make John Jackson win.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and MMM.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b.\nThe third line contains MMM space-separated integers B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BMB_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_MB1\xe2\x80\x8b,B2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,BM\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the smallest number of swaps needed to make John Jackson win, or \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\leq T \\leq 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\le N, M \\leq 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4106 for each valid iii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Bi\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\leq B_i \\leq 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4Bi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4106 for each valid iii\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 10410^4104\nthe sum of MMM over all test cases does not exceed 10410^4104\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points):\n\nA1=A2=\xe2\x80\xa6=ANA_1 = A_2 = \\ldots = A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b=A2\xe2\x80\x8b=\xe2\x80\xa6=AN\xe2\x80\x8b\nB1=B2=\xe2\x80\xa6=BMB_1 = B_2 = \\ldots = B_MB1\xe2\x80\x8b=B2\xe2\x80\x8b=\xe2\x80\xa6=BM\xe2\x80\x8b\n\nSubtask #2 (80 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n2 3\n2 2\n5 5 5\n4 3\n1 3 2 4\n6 7 82\n1\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: We can perform two swaps ? each time, we swap a pack of 222 votes from AAA and a pack of 555 votes from BBB. After that, John Jackson gets 5+5=105+5 = 105+5=10 votes and Jack Johnson gets 2+2+5=92+2+5 = 92+2+5=9 votes.\nExample case 2: We can swap the pack of 111 vote from AAA and the pack of 888 votes from BBB. After that, John Jackson gets 8+3+2+4=178+3+2+4 = 178+3+2+4=17 votes and Jack Johnson gets 6+7+1=146 + 7 + 1 = 146+7+1=14 votes.'
