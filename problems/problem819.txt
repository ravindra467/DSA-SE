b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChefina is playing with ranges. There are NNN ranges [l1,r1],[l2,r2],\xe2\x80\xa6,[lN,rN][l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], \\ldots, [l_N, r_N][l1\xe2\x80\x8b,r1\xe2\x80\x8b],[l2\xe2\x80\x8b,r2\xe2\x80\x8b],\xe2\x80\xa6,[lN\xe2\x80\x8b,rN\xe2\x80\x8b]. Chefina wants to divide the ranges into two non-empty subsets in such a way that each range is in exactly one subset and whenever two ranges have a common point, they are in the same subset.\nSince this could be difficult to achieve, Chefina can delete any number of ranges (possibly zero) and then divide the remaining ranges into such non-empty subsets. She wants to know whether it is possible to achieve her task after deleting some ranges and if it is possible, she also wants to know the minimum number of ranges she needs to delete to achieve it.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nNNN lines follow. For each iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le i \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the iii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers lil_ili\xe2\x80\x8b and rir_iri\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum number of ranges to delete, or \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible to delete some ranges and divide the remaining ranges into two non-empty subsets.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\le T \\le 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le N \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4li\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4li\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid iii\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): N=16N = 16N=16\nSubtask #2 (15 points): N=1,000N = 1,000N=1,000\nSubtask #3 (15 points): ri\xe2\x89\xa4106r_i \\le 10^6ri\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4106 for each valid iii\nSubtask #4 (60 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n3\n1 4\n2 6\n5 7\n2\n1 4\n4 6\n2\n3 7\n8 91\n-1\n0\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: It is enough to delete the range [2,6][2, 6][2,6].\nExample case 2: There is no way to divide these two ranges into two suitable non-empty subsets and deleting any range obviously makes it impossible too.\nExample case 3: There is no need to delete any ranges, we can just put one range into one subset and the other range into the other subset.'
