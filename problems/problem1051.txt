b"Problem\nChef considers a string consisting of lowercase English alphabets beautiful if all the characters of the string are vowels.\nChef has a string SSS consisting of lowercase English alphabets, of length NNN. He wants to convert SSS into a beautiful string TTT. In order to do so, Chef does the following operation on every character of the string:\n\nIf the character is a consonant, change the character to its closest vowel.\nIf the character is a vowel, don't change it.\n\nChef realizes that the final string TTT is not unique. Chef wonders, what is the total number of distinct beautiful strings TTT that can be obtained by performing the given operations on the string SSS.\nSince the answer can be huge, print it modulo 109+710^9 + 7109+7.\nNote:\n\nThere are 262626 characters in the English alphabet. Five of these characters are vowels: a, e, i, o, and u. The remaining 212121 characters are consonants.\nThe closest vowel to a consonant is the vowel that is least distant from that consonant. For example, the distance between the characters d and e is 111 while the distance between the characters d and a is 333.\nThe distance between the characters z and a is 252525 and not 111.\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input will contain an integer TTT \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer NNN, denoting the length of the string SSS.\nThe second line of each test case contains a string SSS consisting of lowercase English alphabets.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output the total number of distinct beautiful strings TTT that can be obtained by performing the given operations on the string SSS, modulo 109+710^9 + 7109+7.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq T \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nSum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 10510^5105.\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4\n5\naeiou\n5\nabcde\n8\nstarters\n8\ncodechef\n1\n2\n4\n4\nExplanation:\nTest case 111: All the characters of the string SSS are vowels. Thus, none of the characters would be changed. The resulting string TTT will be aeiou.\n**Test case 222:**There are 222 possible strings that can be obtained by performing the given operations on the string SSS. Those are aaaee and aaeee."
