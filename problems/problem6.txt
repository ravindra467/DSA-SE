b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nGet excited, folks, because it is time for the final match of Codechef Premier League (CPL)!\nMike and Tracy also want to watch the grand finale, but unfortunately, they could not get tickets to the match. However, Mike is not someone who gives up so easily \xe2\x80\x94 he has a plan to watch the match.\nThe field where the match is played is surrounded by a wall with height KKK. Outside, there are NNN boxes (numbered 111 through NNN). For each valid iii, the iii-th box has a height HiH_iHi\xe2\x80\x8b.\nMike wants to take some boxes and stack them on top of each other to build two towers. The height of each tower is the sum of heights of all the boxes that form it. Of course, no box may be in both towers. The height of each tower should be at least KKK. Then Mike can climb on top of one tower and Tracy on top of the other, and they can watch the match uninterrupted!\nWhile Mike is busy stacking the boxes, Tracy would like to know the smallest number of boxes required to build two towers such that each of them has height at least KKK, or at least that it is impossible to build such towers. Can you help Tracy?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and KKK.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers H1,H2,\xe2\x80\xa6,HNH_1, H_2, \\ldots, H_NH1\xe2\x80\x8b,H2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,HN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the smallest number of boxes required to build two towers, or \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa451 \\leq T \\leq 51\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa44,0001 \\leq N, K \\leq 4,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa44,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Hi\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq H_i \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4Hi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4105 for each valid iii\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq N, K \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Hi\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq H_i \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4Hi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4100 for each valid iii\n\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n8 38\n7 8 19 7 8 7 10 20\n4 5\n2 10 4 97\n2\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: The first tower can be built with boxes 8+10+20=388 + 10 + 20 = 388+10+20=38 and the second tower with boxes 7+7+8+19=417 + 7 + 8 + 19 = 417+7+8+19=41. In this case, the box with height 777 is left unused.\nExample case 2: We only need the box with height 101010 for one tower and the box with height 999 for the other tower.'
