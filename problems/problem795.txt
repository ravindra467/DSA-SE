b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef owns a fast food shop that is currently located in a city called Chefland. He is planning to move his shop to a bigger city called Chefabad. There are NNN consecutive days (numbered 111 through NNN) such that the move can be done before day 111, after day NNN or between any two consecutive days. Moving the shop takes zero time. Chef wants to time the move in a way thay maximises his profit during these NNN days.\nFor each iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le i \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), we know that if Chef's shop is in Chefland on the iii-th day, he earns AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b coins, while if it is in Chefabad on this day, he earns BiB_iBi\xe2\x80\x8b coins. Find the maximum profit Chef can make if he optimally chooses the time when the shop should move. Note that once the shop has moved to Chefabad, it cannot return to Chefland.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases.
