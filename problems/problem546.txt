b"Problem\n\nLets define G(x, {A1, A2, A3, ..., Ax}) as a game played by 2 players in which we have x piles of stones with ith pile having Ai stones. Player 1 moves first. The players move alternatively. In a move a player can select a single non empty pile of stones and remove any number ( > 0 ) of stones from it. When a player cannot make a move, the player loses.\nAdarsh and Saharsh are playing a modification of this game. There are N piles of stones lined up and ith pile has Ai number of stones. Saharsh needs to divide the N piles into disjoint contiguous segments. It is possible for a pile to not belong in a segment at all. The segments need to be selected in such a way such that, if ith pile is in a segment, then all the j's such that Ai = Aj, are also in the segment. Now they play games on these segments considering only the 'distinct sized piles' in the segment with Adarsh as Player 1 and Saharsh as Player 2.\nConsider A = {1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2}.\n\nA possible division is {1, 1} and {2, 3, 3, 2}. \n  For the segment {1, 1}, game G(1, {1}) would be played. For the segment {2, 3, 3, 2}, game G(2, {2, 3}) would be played.\n      \nG(1, {1}) would be won by Player 1\nG(2, {2, 3}) would be won by Player 1\n\n  So number of games that Player 2 wins would be 0.\nAnother possible division is {1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2}. \n  For the segment {1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2}, game G(3, {1, 2, 3}) would be played. \n      G(3, {1, 2, 3}) would be won by Player 2\n  So number of games that Player 2 wins would be 1.\n\nWhat is the maximum possible games that Saharsh can win?\n\nInput Format: \nThe first line contains an integer N, the number of piles.\nNext line contains N space separated integers where ith integer denotes number of stones in the ith pile, Ai.\nOutput Format:\nFor each test case, output the corresponding answer.\nConstraints:\n\n1<= N <=500000\n1<= Ai <=500000\n\nSample Input:\n6\n1 1 2 3 3 2\nSample Output:\n1\nExplanation:\nGiven in the problem statement."
