b"Problem\nAkshay has been given a problem by his teacher to find the maximum sum of subarray given an array of nnn length.\nA subarray of an array is an array composed from a contiguous block of the original array's elements.\nThere is another thing given by the teacher that. Once the above maximum sum subarrays are selected, Akshay is allowed to remove atmost one element from them, to maximise the result further.\nThere should be atleast one element in the subarray at the end. Since Akshay is sleepy, can you solve the problem for him?\nNote: Remember that you can remove atmost one element from a maximum sum subarray and not the other part of array.\nNote: In case of two subarrays having equal value, take that sub-array which will give maximum value after removal of atmost one element.\nInput :\n\nFirst line contains ttt, the number of testcases.\nThe first line of each testcase contains an integer nnn, the number of elements in an array.\nThe second line contains nnn space seperated integers AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b denoting an array.\n\nOutput :\nFor each testcase output a single integer on newline, the maximized final result expected by teacher.\nConstraints :\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le t \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le n \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109-10^9 \\le A_i \\le 10^9\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\nSum of NNN over all tests is atmost 10610^6106.\n\nSample Input :\n2\n5\n1 2 3 -2 3\n2\n-1 -2\n\nSample Output:\n9\n-1\n\nExplanation\nFor the first test case, we first find the maximum sum subarray which is [123\xe2\x88\x9223][1 2 3 -2 3][123\xe2\x88\x9223] with sum = 777. Now chef removes \xe2\x88\x922-2\xe2\x88\x922 and makes final result = 999."
