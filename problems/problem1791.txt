b'Problem\nMotu has KKK boxes and every box is empty at time ttt === 000. Now Patlu gave him coins at some TTT instants of time (1,2,3...T)( 1,2,3 ...T )(1,2,3...T) and asked him to put one coin in each box from box LLL to RRR. Patlu make a record of the data and also asked Motu to do the same. Now he asked Motu some queries and asked him to tell the number of coins present in a box XXX from time t1t1t1 to time t2t2t2 i.e. number of additional coins that are added to the box XXX from [t1,t2)[t1 , t2)[t1,t2) .\nInput:\n\nFirst line of the input contains two integer, TTT and QQQ\nNext TTT lines contains two integers LLL , RRR, where coins are put from box LLL to box RRR.\nNext QQQ lines contains three integers t1t1t1 , t2t2t2 , XXX\n\nOutput:\nFor each query , output in a single line answer, the number of coins present in a box XXX from time instant t1t1t1 to t2t2t2. i.e [t1,t2)[t1 , t2)[t1,t2).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq T \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa41052 \\leq Q \\leq 10^52\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41091\\leq K \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4t1<t2\xe2\x89\xa4T1\\leq t1 \\lt  t2 \\leq  T1\xe2\x89\xa4t1<t2\xe2\x89\xa4T\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4K1\\leq  X \\leq K1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4K\n1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4K1\\leq L \\leq R \\leq  K1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4K\n\nSample Input:\n 4 3\n 1 3\n 3 5\n 1 5\n 1 2\n 2 4 4\n 1 2 3\n 1 4 1\n\nSample Output:\n 2\n 1\n 2\n### EXPLANATION:\n\n\n\nQuery 1: In time 222 to 444, additional  2 coins are added to box 444.\nAt instant 2 : 1 coin is added in box 4.\nAt instant 3 : 1 coin is added in box 4.\nSo answer is 2.\n\n\nQuery 2: In time 111 to 222, additional  1 coin is added to box 333\nAt instant 1:  1 coin is added in box 3.\nSo answer is 1.\n\n\nQuery 3: In time 111 to 444, additional 222 coins are added to box 111\nAt instant 1: 1 coin is added in box 1.\nAt instant 2: no coin is added in box 1.\nAt instant 3: 1 coin is added in box 1.\nSo answer is 2.\n\n'
