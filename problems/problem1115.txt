b'Problem\nYou are given a binary string AAA of length NNN. Rearrange the binary string to form binary strings SSS and TTT such that the length of the longest common substring between SSS and TTT is minimum.\nPrint both strings SSS and TTT.\nNote that both SSS and TTT must be anagrams of AAA \xe2\x80\x94 see the examples below for more clarity.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer TTT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nEach test case consists of two lines.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN \xe2\x80\x94 the length of the binary string AAA.\nThe second line of each test case contains a binary string AAA of length NNN.\n\nOutput Format\n\nFor each test case, output two lines. The first line contains string SSS while the second line contains string TTT. Both strings SSS and TTT must be anagrams of string AAA and thus, have length NNN.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq T \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq N \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000\nSum of NNN over all cases does not exceed 300030003000.\n\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 (100 points): Original constraints\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n3\n101\n4\n1111\n4\n0111110\n011\n1111\n1111\n1101\n0111\nExplanation:\nTest case 111: The given string is A=101A = 101A=101. Two rearrangements of AAA such that the length of longest common substring is minimum are S=110S = 110S=110 and T=011T = 011T=011. The longest common substring between strings SSS and TTT is 111111, having length 222. It can be proved that for no other pair of rearrangements of string AAA, the LCS has a length less than 222.\nTest case 222: The given string is A=1111A = 1111A=1111. Here, all rearrangements of AAA are the same. Two rearrangements of AAA such that the length of longest common substring is minimum are S=1111S = 1111S=1111 and T=1111T = 1111T=1111. The longest common substring between strings SSS and TTT is 111111111111, having length 444.\nTest case 333: The given string is A=0111A = 0111A=0111. Two rearrangements of AAA such that the length of longest common substring is minimum are S=1101S = 1101S=1101 and T=0111T = 0111T=0111. The longest common substring between strings SSS and TTT is 010101 having length 222. It can be proved that for no other pair of rearrangements of string AAA, the LCS has a length less than 222.'
