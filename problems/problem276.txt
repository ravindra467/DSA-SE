That's right, a dakimakura for every resident of Berland!\nIt is known that Berland consists of NNN cities, where CiC_iCi\xe2\x80\x8b people live in city iii and it takes TiT_iTi\xe2\x80\x8b hours to get from city iii to city i+1i + 1i+1.\nThe government is ready to allocate xxx tugriks for the implementation of the project to give out dakimakuras. They also agreed with local producers, so the dakimakuras themselves are free.\nTo implement the project, the government can open a branch for issuing dakimakuras free of charge in several cities. For each city with an open branch for issuing dakimakuras, the government can pay 111 tugrik to increase its productivity by 111 unit. It can be increased any number of times, so that a productivity of kkk units costs kkk tugriks.\nThen the issuance of dakimakuras begins. For each resident of the country that is located in city iii, he/she will travel to the first city with index greater or equal to iii that has a branch. Recall, it takes TiT_iTi\xe2\x80\x8b hours to travel from city iii to i+1i+1i+1. After arrival, he/she enters the queue in the branch.\nFor each branch, it handles the queue as follows.\n\nLet the productivity of this branch be ppp. If there are less than ppp people in the queue, then the branch issues dakimakuras to everyone in the queue. Otherwise, it starts with the first ppp people, and gives them dakimakuras. A branch can only give dakimakuras every hour (that is, integer times since the start). Also, a resident cannot receive a dakimakura at the same moment he/she enters the queue.\n\nYou must find the minimum amount of time required for the government to issue dakimakuras to all residents of Berland, spending no more than xxx tugriks in total. Assume all the residents start travelling at the same time, and the branches also opened at hour 000.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer ttt - the number of test cases. Then ttt test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers NNN and xxx - the number of cities in Berland and the maximum amount of tugriks that the government can spend.\nThe second line contains NNN integers C1,\xe2\x80\xa6,CnC_1, \\ldots, C_nC1\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,Cn\xe2\x80\x8b.\nThe third line contains N\xe2\x88\x921N - 1N\xe2\x88\x921 integers T1,\xe2\x80\xa6,Tn\xe2\x88\x921T_1, \\ldots, T_{n-1}T1\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,Tn\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print in a single line the answer to the problem.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa451 \\leq t \\leq 51\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa45\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41002 \\leq N \\leq 1002\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq x \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4109\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ci\xe2\x89\xa41090 \\leq C_i \\leq 10^90\xe2\x89\xa4Ci\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ti\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq T_i \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Ti\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (20 points): 2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa482 \\leq N \\leq 82\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa48, 1\xe2\x89\xa4x,Ti\xe2\x89\xa481 \\leq x, T_i \\leq 81\xe2\x89\xa4x,Ti\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa48 and 0\xe2\x89\xa4Ci\xe2\x89\xa480 \\leq C_i \\leq 80\xe2\x89\xa4Ci\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa48\nSubtask 2 (20 points): x=1x = 1x=1\nSubtask 3 (40 points): 2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4402 \\leq N \\leq 402\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa440\nSubtask 4 (20 points): Original constraints\n\nSample Input\n2\n5 6\n8 3 1 5 0\n1 1 1 1\n5 1\n2 8 0 0 1\n7 3 1 2\n\nSample Output\n3\n16\n\nExplanation\nThe first test case:\nLet's open a branch in city 111 with productivity 333 and one in city 444 with productivity 333.\nThen in the 000-th hour, 888 people in city 111 and 555 people in city 444 will enter the queues in their respective cities. Meanwhile, the people in cities 222 and 333 will travel to the next city.\nThen in the 111-st hour, 333 people in city 111 and 333 people in city 444 will receive dakimakuras. Now the numbers of remaining people in each city are [5,0,3,3,0][5,0,3,3,0][5,0,3,3,0].\nThen in the 222-nd hour, 333 people in city 111 and 333 people in city 444 will receive dakimakuras. Now the numbers of remaining people in each city are [2,0,0,3,0][2, 0, 0, 3, 0][2,0,0,3,0].\nThen in the 333-rd hour, 222 people in city 111 and 333 people in city 444 will receive dakimakuras. Now, every resident in Berland has received a dakimakura, so the process took 333 hours."
