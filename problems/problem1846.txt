b"Problem\nRatan Singh and Alauddin Khilji are blood-enemies of each other. Ratan Singh has a diverse and well planned kingdom. His kingdom has NNN provinces. Every province has a  bidirectional road to every other province (except itself of course). But Alauddin has now attacked his kingdom. During his attack, he destroyed some of the roads connecting provinces.\nTo fight back, Ratan Singh divided his sena(army) into two senas. Sena XXX and Sena YYY.\nSena XXX has the best warriors, while Sena YYY doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. According to his plan, each province should be protected by exactly one of the two senas( XXX or YYY).\nAs Sena XXX is very strong, Ratan Singh will place them in such a way that:\n\nNo two adjacent provinces (provinces connected by a road) are guarded by Sena XXX.\nIf a province PPP is guarded by Sena XXX, then all the provinces which are guarded by Sena YYY needs to be adjacent to province PPP.\nThere should exist at least one province having Sena XXX, and at least one province having Sena YYY.\n\nThis way, he can ensure the safety of his Kingdom.\nYou are the only programmer that Khilji has. You have to help him calculate the number of possible ways in which Ratan Singh can achieve the aforementioned task!\nNOTE : Please use Fast I/O methods as the input can be large.\nInput Format\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nFirst line of each test-case consists of two spaced integers, NNN and MMM, denoting the number of provinces in Ratan Singh's Kingdom, and the number of roads destroyed by Khilji respectively.\nThen, MMM lines follow:\nEach of these lines consists of two spaced integers, uuu vvv, denoting that the road connecting provinces uuu and vvv has been destroyed by Khilji.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each testcase, print the number of possible ways in which Ratan Singh can deploy his Senas, following the conditions mentioned in the statement.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq T \\leq 10^{5}1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851052 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^{5}2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4min(N\xe2\x8b\x85(N\xe2\x88\x921)2,3\xe2\x8b\x85105)0 \\leq M \\leq min( \\frac{N \\cdot (N-1)}{2},3 \\cdot 10^{5})0\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4min(2N\xe2\x8b\x85(N\xe2\x88\x921)\xe2\x80\x8b,3\xe2\x8b\x85105)\nu\xe2\x89\xa0vu \\neq vu\xee\x80\xa0=v.\nAll the edges mentioned in the input are unique.\nThe sum of NNN over all cases doesn't exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052 \\cdot 10^{5}2\xe2\x8b\x85105\nThe sum of MMM over all cases doesn't exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x851055 \\cdot 10^{5}5\xe2\x8b\x85105.\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n6 5\n1 6\n2 4\n2 5\n3 5\n4 5\n1\n\nExplanation:\n\n\nThe only possible way to deploy the senas is, deploy the Sena XXX at provinces :[1,6][1,6][1,6] and the ena YYY at provinces : [3,2,4,5][3,2,4,5][3,2,4,5]. For any of the provinces having Sena XXX, it can be seen that, every province of sena YYY is adjacent to it. Province 111 is adjacent to [3,2,4,5][3,2,4,5][3,2,4,5], the same follows for the province 666.\n\n\nHe cannot deploy sena XXX at [3,2,4,5][3,2,4,5][3,2,4,5] and YYY at [1,6][1,6][1,6] because in the resulting graph, provinces 3,23,23,2 as well as provinces 3,43,43,4 are adjacent.\n\n"
