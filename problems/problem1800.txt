b'Problem\nPhoebe starts her own fitness class. There are NNN people standing in a row waiting to start their exercise. The ithi^{th}ith person is standing at point XiX_iXi\xe2\x80\x8b where 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n1\\leq i\\leq n1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n. The length of the hands of each person is fixed as KKK units.\n![image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-assets/0/1578339615-f16a2390b3-Untitled-1-01-02copy.jpg =260x147)\nEach person exercises by raising their hands to the side. Now phoebe wants the exercise to be Perfect. Perfect exercise is possible if there is no overlapping of hands between two persons when they raise their hands side by side. An example of Perfect exercise is :\n![image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-assets/0/1578339639-eb53e54a14-Untitled-1-01-02.jpg =300x142)\nAnd if the hands are overlapping then it is Imperfect exercise. For example :\n![image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-assets/0/1578339655-22de9bf4da-Untitled-1-01-01.jpg =160x150)\nIf the hands of two people are only touching i.e. if A+k=B\xe2\x88\x92kA+k = B-kA+k=B\xe2\x88\x92k then this is not considered as overlapping. Now you have to output if the given set of positions with hand length KKK is Perfect or Imperfect.\nInput:\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer QQQ i.e the number of queries. Then, QQQ lines follow. Each query consists of two lines.\nThe first line of each query contains the value of NNN and KKK. The second line of each query contains NNN space-separated integers denoting XiX_iXi\xe2\x80\x8b which is the position of ithi_{th}ith\xe2\x80\x8b person.\nOutput:\nFor each query, output "Perfect" in a single line if it is possible to do the exercise without overlapping. Or else, output "Imperfect" in a single line.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq T \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^{5}1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq K \\leq 10^{9}1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4109\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Xi\xe2\x89\xa41090 \\leq X_i \\leq 10^{9}0\xe2\x89\xa4Xi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSample Input:\n2\r\n3 1\r\n6 1 3\r\n3 1\r\n6 1 2\n\nSample Output:\nPerfect\r\nImperfect\n\nEXPLANATION:\nIn the second example, the second and third person\'s hands will overlap. Therefore it is imperfect.'
