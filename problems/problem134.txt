b"Problem\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a grid of (not necessarily non-negative) integers GGG with NNN rows and MMM columns. Let's denote the integer in the cell (i,j)(i, j)(i,j) of this grid by Gi,jG_{i,j}Gi,j\xe2\x80\x8b; the rows and columns use 1-based indexing.\nFormally, let's call a non-empty subset of cells of the grid a plus sign if:\n\nit is connected\nthere is a central cell (i,j)(i, j)(i,j) which belongs to the subset\neach other (non-central) cell from the subset is either in row iii or column jjj\nthe central cell is adjacent to 4 other cells in all 4 directions\n\nYou should find the maximum possible sum of integers written in the cells belonging to a plus sign in the grid.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and MMM.\nNNN lines follow. For each iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le i \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the iii-th of these lines contains MMM space-separated integers Gi,1,Gi,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Gi,MG_{i,1}, G_{i,2}, \\dots, G_{i, M}Gi,1\xe2\x80\x8b,Gi,2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,Gi,M\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum sum of a plus sign.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le T \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n3\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41,0003 \\le N, M \\le 1,0003\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nthe sum of NNN in all test cases does not exceed 1,0001,0001,000\nthe sum of MMM in all test cases does not exceed 1,0001,0001,000\n\xe2\x88\xa3Gi,j\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa41,000,000|G_{i,j}| \\le 1,000,000\xe2\x88\xa3Gi,j\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa41,000,000 for each valid i,ji, ji,j\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points):\n\nthe sum of NNN in all test cases does not exceed 100100100\nthe sum of MMM in all test cases does not exceed 100100100\n\nSubtask #2 (80 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n3 4\n1 1 1 1\n-6 1 1 -4\n1 1 1 10"
