b"Problem\nWARNING: The Input files may be as large as 8 MB. Use faster I/O methods.\nThere is a tree, consisting of N nodes. A path is a sequence of one or more nodes of this tree, where every two adjacent nodes are connected by an edge and no node is visited twice. Generally, there are N2 paths. Note that we are counting paths from each node onto itself as well. One path is smaller than another if the sequence of nodes of the first path is lexicographically smaller than the sequence of nodes of the second path (by usual rules).\nThus (1,3,2) will be smaller than (1,3,4,5). And (2,4) will be smaller than (3).\nEvery day, Lucy writes out a path on a sheet of paper. On the first day, she writes the lexicographically smallest path. On the second day, she writes the lexicographically second smallest path, and so on. Generally, on the Kth day, Lucy writes out the lexicographically Kth smallest path.\nNana likes to read Lucy's notes about the paths in the tree. She is curious about the path that will be written on the Qth day. Could you please help her?\nInput\nThe first line of input consists of a single integer T, the number of the test cases. Then, there are T test cases, given in the following form: the first line of the test case consists of an integer N, the number of nodes and an integer Q, the number from the statement. Then, N-1 lines follow. Each such line will consist of two integers X and Y with the meaning that there's an edge, connecting nodes X and Y in the tree. You may assume that you are always given a valid tree.\nOutput\nFor every test case, output the lexicographically Qth smallest path in the given tree on a single line, without leading or trailing spaces. There should be exactly one space between successive nodes in the path. Output the answer to the tth test case should be given on the tth line.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xe2\x89\xa4 N2\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Sum of N over all the test cases in the single file \xe2\x89\xa4 1000000\n\nSample Input\n3\n6 21\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n2 5\n2 6\n7 35\n1 2\n1 3\n3 4\n4 5\n4 6\n4 7\n6 16\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n2 5\n1 6\n\nSample Output\n4 2 1\n5 4 7\n3 1 2 5\n\nExplanation\nIn the first test case, there are 36 paths in total.
