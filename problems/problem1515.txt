b'Problem\nGiven a acyclic graph with N nodes and E undirected edges and degree (number of edges incident on that node) of every node is less than 3.\n\nFind the maximum number of edges that can be added, such that there is no cycle of odd length in the final graph.\n\nNote:\nThere is no restriction on the final degree of the nodes and\nthere is no self loop or multiple edges in the final graph\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains a 2 integers N and E denoting the number of nodes and number of edges.\nNext E lines contains 2 integers a and b denoting that there is an edge between node a and b.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the required answer.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 E \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 a,b \xe2\x89\xa4 N\nSum of E over all testcases <= 1000000\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n1\n3 1\n1 2 \nOutput:\n1\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nOnly one more edge can be added either (1,3) or (2,3)'
