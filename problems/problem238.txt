b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef is playing a card game called Blackjack. He starts with a deck of NNN cards (numbered 111 through NNN), where for each valid iii, the iii-th card has an integer AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b written on it. Then he starts dealing the cards one by one in the order from card 111 to card NNN. Chef wins if at some moment in time, the sum of all the cards dealt so far is between XXX and YYY inclusive; if this never happens, Chef loses.\nWe want Chef to win the game, so without him noticing, we will swap some pairs of cards (possibly none) before the game starts. Find the smallest number of swaps we need so that Chef would win the game, or determine that it is impossible to make Chef win.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NNN, XXX and YYY.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the smallest required number of swaps or \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 if Chef cannot win.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq T \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,X,Y\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\leq N,X,Y \\leq 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4N,X,Y\xe2\x89\xa4103\nX\xe2\x89\xa4YX \\leq YX\xe2\x89\xa4Y\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4103 for each valid iii\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 10410^4104\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (22 points): Chef can win if we make up to 222 swaps\nSubtask #2 (34 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,X,Y\xe2\x89\xa44001 \\leq N,X,Y \\leq 4001\xe2\x89\xa4N,X,Y\xe2\x89\xa4400\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa44001 \\leq A_i \\leq 4001\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4400 for each valid iii\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 4,0004,0004,000\n\nSubtask #3 (44 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n3 4 5\n1 2 3\n3 3 4\n1 2 3\n2 20 30\n40 101\n0\n-1\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: We can swap the last card with one of the first two cards.\nExample case 2: No swaps are necessary, Chef wins after dealing the first two cards.\nExample case 3: The order of the cards in the deck does not matter, Chef cannot win.'
