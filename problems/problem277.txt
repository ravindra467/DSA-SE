b"Problem\nThere is an urgent need of NNN agents for NNN missions. The missions are numbered from 111 to NNN. All agents have some intelligence level denoted by their IQ (a positive integer ) . Major Francis asked Perry the platypus for the list of agents to be sent on missions. For each mission: iii, there is \xc2\xa0a default agent available (AiAiAi) , and an Special agent (BiBiBi) which may want some money(CiCiCi)\xc2\xa0 to go on mission. Perry is busy with Candice, now you have to prepare the list of agents with the minimum amount to pay. Remember that Perry loves sorted things.\nMore formally you have to make a non\xe2\x88\x92decreasingnon-decreasingnon\xe2\x88\x92decreasing list of the agent's IQ by either selecting a default agent or paid agent , with minimumminimumminimum possiblepossiblepossible payment, Or determine that list cannot be made.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nEach testcase consists of 444 lines.\nFirst line of each testcase contains integer NNN denoting no. of missions.\nSecond line contains NNN space separated integers   (AiAiAi)\r\ndescribing IQ level of default agent for the ithithith mission .\nThird line contains NNN space separated integers  (BiBiBi)\r\ndescribing IQ level of special agent for the ithithith mission.\nFourth line contains NNN space separated integers   (CiCiCi)\r\ndescribing the cost  of  ithithith special agent.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, print in a single line the minimum cost that satisfys the given condition or \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921  , if not possible.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq T \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa440001 \\leq N \\leq 40001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa44000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,Bi\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq  Ai ,  Bi \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,Bi\xe2\x89\xa4109\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ci\xe2\x89\xa41000 \\leq  Ci  \\leq 1000\xe2\x89\xa4Ci\xe2\x89\xa4100\n\nSample Input:\n3\n3\n1 4  2\n5 2 6\n4 5 6\n2\n5 2\n6 2\n7 2\n4\n4  2  2  5\n1  4  5  8\n10 2 3  16\nSample Output:\n5\n-1\n5\nEXPLANATION:\nIn first testcase  agents list possibles are:\t[1 ,2 ,2] with 5 cost  and, [1 ,4, 6]  with 6 cost .\r\nIn second no sorted list of agents are possible :)"
