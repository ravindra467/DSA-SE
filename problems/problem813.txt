b"Problem\nNathan is preparing for the Dash marathon. He has NNN training plans. The iii-th plan has an effectiveness of AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b, but requires that at least BiB_iBi\xe2\x80\x8b other training plans must be performed before it. A training plan cannot be repeated.\nIf he performs some K>0K \\gt 0K>0 distinct trainings - P1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PKP_1, P_2, \\ldots , P_KP1\xe2\x80\x8b,P2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,PK\xe2\x80\x8b (1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa4N,Pi\xe2\x89\xa0Pj)(1 \\le P_i \\le N, P_i \\neq P_j)(1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4N,Pi\xe2\x80\x8b\xee\x80\xa0=Pj\xe2\x80\x8b) then his training score is \xe2\x88\x91j=1KAPjK\\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{K} A_{P_j}}{K}K\xe2\x88\x91j=1K\xe2\x80\x8bAPj\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b. If Nathan does not perform any training plan (K=0)(K = 0)(K=0), then his score is 000.\nWhat is the highest score that Nathan can get by performing zero or more training plans, if he can perform them in any order?\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT - the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains NNN - the number of training plans.\nThe second line contains NNN integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b where AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b is the effectiveness of the iii-th training plan.\nThe third line contains NNN integers B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BNB_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_NB1\xe2\x80\x8b,B2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN\xe2\x80\x8b where BiB_iBi\xe2\x80\x8b is the number of pre-requisite training plans for the iii-th training plan.\n\nOutput Format\n\nFor each test case, output a single real number - the highest score that Nathan can get by performing zero or more training plans.\nYour answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10\xe2\x88\x92610^{-6}10\xe2\x88\x926.\nFormally, let your answer be XXX, and the jury's answer be YYY.
