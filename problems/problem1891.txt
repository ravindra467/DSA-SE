b"Problem\nNaruto is done visiting all the villages. It turns out that this was a secret mission to collect data that might be useful.\nNaruto found out that each village belongs to a group GGG. Let's define GiG_iGi\xe2\x80\x8b as the group to which the ithi^{th}ith village belongs. As we already know, The whole network of villages is in the form of a rooted tree, where each village represents a vertex, with village 111 being the root vertex. In particular, 222 villages are connected if there is a path in between them.\nThis grouping might be a threat to Naruto's own village so he wants to be prepared for the worse. The threat level of a group in village iii  is the number of villages belonging to that group in the subtree of the village iii.\nNaruto is only concerned with the highest threat level. For each village, find the highest threat level.\nInput:\n\nThe First line will contain NNN, number of villages.\nThe Second line contains NNN space-separated integers G1,G2,G3,....,GNG_1,G_2,G_3,....,G_NG1\xe2\x80\x8b,G2\xe2\x80\x8b,G3\xe2\x80\x8b,....,GN\xe2\x80\x8b, where GiG_iGi\xe2\x80\x8b is the group to which the ithi^{th}ith village belongs.\nNext N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contain 222 space-separated integers xxx and yyy denoting that villages xxx and yyy are connected by a path.### Output:\nPrint NNN space-separted integers A1,A2,..,ANA_1,A_2,..,A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,..,AN\xe2\x80\x8b, where AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b denotes the highest threat level of the ithi^{th}ith village\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x88\x971041 \\leq N \\leq 5*10^41\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x88\x97104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Gi\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq G_i\\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4Gi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq x,y\\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4N\nx!=yx!=yx!=y\n\nSample Input:\n5\n2 2 2 3 3\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n\nSample Output:\n3 2 1 1 1### Explanation: \n\nIf you draw the tree with its group name you will observe that root 111 has 333 number of 2\xe2\x80\xb2s2's2\xe2\x80\xb2s and 222 number of  3\xe2\x80\xb2s3's3\xe2\x80\xb2s in its subtree, so threat level is 333.  Vertex 222 has one 222 and two 3\xe2\x80\xb2s3's3\xe2\x80\xb2s in its subtree, so threat level is 222. Vertex 333,444 and 555 have only one 222, one 333 and one 333, so threat level for vertex 3,4,53, 4, 53,4,5 will be 1,1,11, 1 ,11,1,1."
