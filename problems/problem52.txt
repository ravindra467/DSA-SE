b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nThere is a building with NNN floors (numbered 111 through NNN from bottom to top); on each floor, there are MMM windows (numbered 111 through MMM from left to right). Let's denote the jjj-th window on the iii-th floor by (i,j)(i, j)(i,j).\nAll windows in the building need to be cleaned one by one in a specific order. You are given this order as a matrix AAA with NNN rows and MMM columns; for each valid iii and jjj, the window (i,j)(i, j)(i,j) must be cleaned on the AN\xe2\x88\x92i+1,jA_{N-i+1,j}AN\xe2\x88\x92i+1,j\xe2\x80\x8b-th turn.\nWhenever we clean a window (i,j)(i, j)(i,j), it becomes clean, but the dirty water used for cleaning it flows down to windows (i\xe2\x88\x921,j\xe2\x88\x921)(i-1, j-1)(i\xe2\x88\x921,j\xe2\x88\x921), (i\xe2\x88\x921,j)(i-1, j)(i\xe2\x88\x921,j) and (i\xe2\x88\x921,j+1)(i-1, j+1)(i\xe2\x88\x921,j+1) (more precisely, to all of these windows which exist), so these windows become dirty again. Then, the water flows further down, so the same applies for other windows below: whenever a window (i,j)(i, j)(i,j) becomes dirty, windows (i\xe2\x88\x921,j\xe2\x88\x921)(i-1, j-1)(i\xe2\x88\x921,j\xe2\x88\x921), (i\xe2\x88\x921,j)(i-1, j)(i\xe2\x88\x921,j) and (i\xe2\x88\x921,j+1)(i-1, j+1)(i\xe2\x88\x921,j+1) become dirty as well. For example, cleaning a window (5,3)(5, 3)(5,3) will make the window (3,2)(3, 2)(3,2) dirty. The next window is cleaned only after water flows down completely. Note that each window is cleaned only once and there may be dirty windows at the end.\nFor each window, determine whether it will be clean after the cleaning process ends.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and MMM.\nNNN lines follow. For each iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le i \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the iii-th of these lines contains MMM space-separated integers Ai,1,Ai,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ai,MA_{i, 1}, A_{i, 2}, \\ldots, A_{i, M}Ai,1\xe2\x80\x8b,Ai,2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ai,M\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print NNN lines; each of them should contain a string with length MMM. For each valid iii and jjj, the jjj-th character on the iii-th line should be '1' if the window (N\xe2\x88\x92i+1,j)(N-i+1, j)(N\xe2\x88\x92i+1,j) is clean or '0' if it is dirty.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le T \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\le N, M \\le 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,j\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x8b\x85M1 \\le A_{i, j} \\le N \\cdot M1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,j\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x8b\x85M for each valid i,ji, ji,j\nthe elements of the matrix AAA are pairwise distinct\nthe sum of N\xe2\x8b\x85MN \\cdot MN\xe2\x8b\x85M over all test cases does not exceed 10610^6106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points):\n\nN,M\xe2\x89\xa425N, M \\le 25N,M\xe2\x89\xa425\nthe sum of N\xe2\x8b\x85MN \\cdot MN\xe2\x8b\x85M over all test cases does not exceed 625625625\n\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n3 4\n1 3 7 10\n9 2 4 11\n8 12 5 61111\n1001\n0100"
