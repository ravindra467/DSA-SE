b'Problem\nManish loves solving mathematical problems. So, one day his professor gave him an interesting problem to solve. His professor gave him a number n and Manish need to do the following\noperation:-\nFind the sum of the digits of n. Let the sum be m.\nIf  m contains only one digit than stop! , else assign the value of m to n. Also not be a multiple of 9. If so then print 0.\nManish is required to perform the above operations until n is reduced to a single digit. Manish need to tell what that single digit will be.\nAs the question is a little tricky, he needs your help. Help Manish to find that single digit.\nINPUT FORMAT:-\nThe first line of the input consists of a single integer \xe2\x80\x98 t \xe2\x80\x99 denoting the number of test cases.\nEach test case consists of a single integer \xe2\x80\x98 n \xe2\x80\x98 .\nOUTPUT FORMAT:-\nFor each test case output a single integer denoting the ans, that is that single digit as described in the question.\nCONSTRAINTS:-\n1 <=  t  <= 10^5\n1 <= n <= 10^18\nSAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:-\nINPUT 1:-\n5\n5\n345\n896\n7889\n56\nOUTPUT 1:-\n5\n3\n5\n5\n2\nEXPLANATION:-\nTake n =  345, => 3+4+5 = 12=>1+2=3. So ans = 3.'
