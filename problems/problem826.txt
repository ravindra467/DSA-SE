b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nThere are NNN light bulbs in a row, numbered 111 through NNN from left to right. Each bulb can be in one of the states "on" or "off". Initially, all the bulbs are "off". Each bulb is also connected to its (at most two) adjacent bulbs by wires.\nYou should reach a state described by a given a binary string SSS with length NNN \xe2\x80\x95 for each valid iii, if the iii-th character of SSS is \'1\', the iii-th bulb should be "on", and if it is \'0\', the iii-th bulb should be "off". You may do that by performing the following steps in the given order:\n\nCut up to KKK of the N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 wires between adjacent bulbs (possibly none of them).\nSwitch on some bulbs (possibly none). Here, whenever two bulbs are still connected by wires (directly or indirectly) and one of them gets switched on, then the other one also gets switched on.\nDisconnect some bulbs from the electrical network. Here, disconnecting a bulb switches it off, but it does not affect any other bulbs \xe2\x80\x95 if a bulb was switched on before this step and it was not disconnected in this step, it remains switched on afterwards.\n\nMinimise the number of bulbs you need to disconnect in step 3 in order to reach the given final state of the bulbs.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and KKK.\nThe second line contains a single string SSS.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the smallest number of bulbs you need to disconnect.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le T \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4K<N\xe2\x89\xa41050 \\le K \\lt N \\le 10^50\xe2\x89\xa4K<N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3=N|S| = N\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3=N\nSSS contains only characters \'0\' and \'1\'\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x851055 \\cdot 10^55\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n5 2\n010011\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: We can cut the wires between pairs of bulbs (2,3)(2, 3)(2,3) and (4,5)(4, 5)(4,5), switch on bulbs 111, 222 and 555, and then disconnect bulb 111.'
