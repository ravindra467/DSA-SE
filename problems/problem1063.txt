b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has always been fond of girls, but he could not make any girl his friend. In order to finally make one, he was asked to solve the following problem:\nYou are given a string SSS with length NNN. Choose an integer KKK and two non-empty subsequences AAA and BBB of characters of this string, each with length KKK, such that:\n\nA=BA = BA=B, i.e. for each valid iii, the iii-th character in AAA is the same as the iii-th character in BBB.\nLet's denote the indices of characters used to construct AAA by a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aKa_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_Ka1\xe2\x80\x8b,a2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,aK\xe2\x80\x8b, i.e. A=(Sa1,Sa2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SaK)A = (S_{a_1}, S_{a_2}, \\ldots, S_{a_K})A=(Sa1\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b,Sa2\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,SaK\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b). Similarly, let's denote the indices of characters used to construct BBB by b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bKb_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_Kb1\xe2\x80\x8b,b2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,bK\xe2\x80\x8b.\nIf we denote the number of common indices in the sequences aaa and bbb by MMM, then M+1\xe2\x89\xa4KM+1 \\le KM+1\xe2\x89\xa4K.\n\nSince Chef is busy right now, he asks you to find the maximum value of KKK such that it is possible to find sequences AAA and BBB which satisfy the given conditions or determine that there is no such KKK.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nThe second line contains a single string SSS with length NNN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the maximum KKK, or 000 if there is no solution.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le T \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le N \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nSSS contains only lowercase English letters\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points): N\xe2\x89\xa48N \\le 8N\xe2\x89\xa48\nSubtask #2 (80 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n4\nanxa1"
