b'Problem\nThere is a planet named \xe2\x80\x9cRuizland\xe2\x80\x9d having NNN cities, These cities are connected in the form of a tree by a bidirectional path of specified length(in miles). Cities are numbered from 111 to NNN. City number 111 is the capital city.\nMMM pilgrims started their journey from the capital city having initial energy E1,E2,\xe2\x80\xa6,EME_1, E_2, \\ldots, E_ME1\xe2\x80\x8b,E2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,EM\xe2\x80\x8b respectively which reduces on moving from one city to another by a certain amount(A)(A)(A).\nAAA is calculated as follows:-\n\nConsider two cities UUU and VVV having an edge length of KKK miles.\nThe total number of distinct cities from the capital city to the city UUU is DDD (city UUU and capital city both are inclusive).\nIf a pilgrim moves from city UUU to VVV, then A=K\xe2\x88\x97DA=K*DA=K\xe2\x88\x97D.\n\nOut of NNN cities, There are some special cities (except the capital city) that are connected to only one city. All pilgrims want to reach any of the special cities. A pilgrim will stop his journey as soon as the energy of the pilgrims becomes 000 or reaches any of the special cities.\nInitially, all cities have 000 pilgrims except the capital city.\nFind the maximum count of special cities that is non-empty (at least one pilgrim is present) after the end of the journey of all the pilgrims given that pilgrims are allowed to take any path during their journey.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers NNN and MMM separated by space, where NNN is the number of cities and MMM is the number of pilgrims.\nThe second line contains MMM integers separated by spaces, denoting the initial energy of the pilgrims.\nNext, N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 lines consists of three integers UUU, VVV and KKK separated by space where city UUU and VVV are connected by a bidirectional path whose length is KKK miles\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, Print the maximum count of special cities that is non-empty (at least one pilgrim is present) after the end of the journey of all the pilgrims.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4501 \\leq T \\leq 501\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa450\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41052 \\leq N \\leq 10^52\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq M \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ei\xe2\x89\xa410181 \\leq E_i \\leq 10^{18}1\xe2\x89\xa4Ei\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa41018\n1\xe2\x89\xa4U,V\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq U, V \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4U,V\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\leq K \\leq 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4106\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 10510^5105.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of MMM over all test cases does not exceed 10510^5105.\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n6 4\n100 20 10 50\n1 2 10\n2 3 20\n2 4 30\n4 5 40\n1 6 502\nExplanation:\nThere are 333 special cities namely 3,53, 53,5 and 666. The energy expected to reach these special cities are 50,19050, 19050,190 and 505050 respectively. Special city 555 cannot be reached by any pilgrim. If Pilgrim 111 goes to the special city 333 and pilgrim 444 goes to the special city 666, then the maximum number of non-empty special cities is 222.'
