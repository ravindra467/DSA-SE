b"Problem\nThe chef has recently learned a new recipe to make pizza. Basically chef has NNN ingredients and each ingredient iii has a cost cic_{i}ci\xe2\x80\x8b.\nA topping for the pizza is prepared by taking at least MMM ingredients and the cost of making a topping is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum cost of the ingredient involved in making this topping. Each ingredient must be present in exactly one topping, and also it is not allowed to leave any ingredient.\nLet the number of toppings prepared by the chef be XXX (1\xe2\x89\xa4X)(1 \\leq X)(1\xe2\x89\xa4X) following the above constraint and the cost of toppings be denoted by t1,t2,t3,....,txt1, t2, t3, ...., txt1,t2,t3,....,tx. The overall cost of the pizza is defined as the maximum of the cost of all such toppings i.e max(t1,t2,t3,....,tx)max(t1, t2, t3, ...., tx)max(t1,t2,t3,....,tx). Help the chef to find the minimum cost in which the pizza can be prepared i.e. you need to minimize max(t1,t2,t3,....,tx)max(t1, t2, t3, ...., tx)max(t1,t2,t3,....,tx).\nNote:\nYou need to minimize the overall cost of the pizza, you don't need to maximize or minimize the cost of any topping or the number of toppings.\nInput :\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line contains two integers NNN and MMM, denoting the number of ingredients and the minimum size of the group of ingredients for preparing a topping.\nThe second line contains N space separated c1,c2,c3,...,cnc_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}, ..., c_{n}c1\xe2\x80\x8b,c2\xe2\x80\x8b,c3\xe2\x80\x8b,...,cn\xe2\x80\x8b integers denoting the cost of each ingredient.\nOutput:\nFor each test case, print a single integer denoting the minimum cost to prepare the pizza.\nConstraints:\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq T \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42000001 \\leq M \\leq N \\leq 2000001\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4200000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ci\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq C_{i} \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Ci\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\nSum of N over all the test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x88\x971052*10^52\xe2\x88\x97105\n\nSample Input:\n2\n6 6\n10 8 12 1 3 7\n5 2\n2 8 9 12 14\n\nSample Output:\n11\n6\n\nExplanation:\nIn the first test case we have to take the whole array, so difference between the maximum and minimum is 12 - 1 = 11.\nIn the second test case, we can partition our array into [2,8] and [9,12,14] so the overall cost is max((8-2),(14-9)) = 6."
