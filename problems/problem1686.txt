b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef\'s college is conducting an online exam, where his camera will be monitored by one or more invigilators (supervisors). Once again, Chef failed to prepare for the exam on time and decided to google answers during it.\nThe exam starts at time 000 and ends at time FFF minutes. Chef needs a total of KKK minutes of googling during the exam in order to pass it. There are NNN invigilators (numbered 111 through NNN); for each valid iii, the iii-th invigilator monitors Chef\'s camera during the time interval starting at SiS_iSi\xe2\x80\x8b minutes since the start of the exam and ending at EiE_iEi\xe2\x80\x8b minutes (where 0\xe2\x89\xa4Si\xe2\x89\xa4Ei\xe2\x89\xa4F0 \\leq S_i \\leq E_i \\leq F0\xe2\x89\xa4Si\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4Ei\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4F). He was resourceful enough to somehow get hold of these times and now he wants to know if he would be able to pass the exam if he googles the answers during the times when no one is looking at his camera.\nNote: The time of googling need not be continuous and there can be multiple invigilators at some interval of time.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NNN, KKK and FFF.\nNNN lines follow. For each valid iii, the iii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers SiS_iSi\xe2\x80\x8b and EiE_iEi\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to pass the exam or "NO" if it is impossible.\nYou may print each character of each string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will all be treated as identical).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq T \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4F\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq F \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4F\xe2\x89\xa4109\n0\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4F0 \\leq K \\leq F0\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4F\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Si\xe2\x89\xa4Ei\xe2\x89\xa4F0 \\leq S_i \\leq E_i \\leq F0\xe2\x89\xa4Si\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4Ei\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4F for each valid iii\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052 \\cdot 10^52\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n1 10 10\n0 10\n2 2 10\n0 5\n7 10\n2 2 100\n0 5\n5 10NO\nYES\nYES\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: There is no point during the exam when Chef is not monitored, so he is unable to google even for a single second and will fail the exam.\nExample case 2: Chef can google for 222 minutes (in the time interval [5,7][5, 7][5,7], when he is not monitored) and hence will be able to pass the exam.\nExample case 3: Chef can google for 222 minutes (in the time interval [10,12][10, 12][10,12]) and hence will be able to pass the exam.'
