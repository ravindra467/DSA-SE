b'Problem\nGiven a string consisting of only lowercase English alphabets, your task is to find the smallest palindromic substring.\r\nIn case there are multiple palindromic substrings of the same length present, print the lexicographically smallest substring.\nFormally, a substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. So in a string "abcdef", "abc" is a substring whereas "adf" is not a substring.\nA palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards, e.g. madam or mom.\nInput:\n\nFirst-line will contain TTT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nEach test case contains of two lines of input, two integers.\n\nFirst, we have a single integer NNN which signifies the length of the substring.\nNext, we have a string of length NNN that only has lowercase English alphabets.\n\n\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line the shortest palindromic substring.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq T \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41052 \\leq N \\leq 10^52\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\nSample Input:\n    2\r\n    2\r\n    zy\r\n    1\r\n    cd\n\nSample Output:\n    y\r\n    c\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThere are only two possibilities. "z" and "y". Since both of them have the same length. We print the lexicographically smaller substring which is y.'
