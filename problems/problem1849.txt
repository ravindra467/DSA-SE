b'Problem\nNearly 109+710^{9} + 7109+7 trillion kilometers far away from the Milkyway, there exists a parallel Universe of Light called the Cosmos of Solon where each planet is called a Temple. There are total NNN temples. Unlike humans, the Solomons (Giant aliens of the Light World) can travel from one temple to another through Cosmic Bridges and the distance observed by them between any two temples is 000 units (Interesting? Well, they travel with more than the speed of light)\nBut the year 202020202020, proved to be a curse for Solomons. This year, a Mega Star Urus struck their Universe and damaged many Cosmic Bridges. However the God of Light ensured that for any two distinct temples uuu and vvv there exists exactly one unique path through Cosmic Bridge(s), but the distance between two directly connected temples through a Bridge has now increased to 111 units.\nTo prevail the existence of this Universe, the God of Light carved himself into exactly NNN Solomons which now rule the NNN temples and are independent of each other. One by one, the ithi^{th}ith Solomon (0\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x9210 \\leq i \\leq N-10\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x921) transmits Light pulses through the network of Cosmic Bridges and determines the sum of distances to the remaining N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 Solomons.\nCan you help them find these quantities so they can reunite into God of Light again?\nInput Format:\n\nThe first line of the input contains NNN, the total no. of temples.\nEach of the next N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contain two space-separated integers uuu and vvv (u\xe2\x89\xa0vu \\neq vu\xee\x80\xa0=v) denoting the bidirectional Cosmic Bridge between temples uuu and vvv.\n\nOutput Format:\nPrint NNN space separated integers in a single line where the ithi^{th}ith integer denotes the sum of distances from the ithi^{th}ith (0\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x9210 \\leq i \\leq N-10\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x921) Solomon to the rest of N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 Solomons.\nConstraints:\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\leq N \\leq 10^{6}1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\n0\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x9210 \\leq u, v \\leq N-10\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x921\n\nSample Input:\n 5\r\n 0 2\r\n 0 3\r\n 1 3\r\n 3 4\n\nSample Output:\n 6 8 9 5 8\n\nExplanation:\n\nFor temple 000 : distance(111) + distance(222) + distance(333) + distance(444) = 2+1+1+2=62+1+1+2=62+1+1+2=6\nFor temple 111 : distance(000) + distance(222) + distance(333) + distance(444) = 2+3+1+2=82+3+1+2=82+3+1+2=8\nFor temple 222 : distance(000) + distance(111) + distance(333) + distance(444) = 1+3+2+3=91+3+2+3=91+3+2+3=9\nFor temple 333 : distance(000) + distance(111) + distance(222) + distance(444) = 1+1+2+1=51+1+2+1=51+1+2+1=5\nFor temple 444 : distance(000) + distance(111) + distance(222) + distance(333) = 2+2+3+1=82+2+3+1=82+2+3+1=8\n'
