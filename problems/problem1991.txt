b'Problem\nYou are in dire need of Bhel Puri. But you don\xe2\x80\x99t know the exact way to reach the Bhel Puri shop. (Hint: The path from your home to the Bhel Puri shop is like a grid) You use your mobile\xe2\x80\x99s GPS and it gives you instructions: T,L,R,DT,L,R,DT,L,R,D. Find the minimum cost path from top left to bottom right given that you can travel in the direction instructed by the GPS or move in a different direction and incur a penalty of 111 for each change. (Note that for a cell in the grid the change of direction can only be done once.) Let\xe2\x80\x99s see if you can find a path to enjoy Bhel Puri :)\nInput Format\n\nFirst-line contains two space-separated integers n,mn,mn,m representing the number of rows and columns of the grid\nFor next nnn lines, each line contains mmm space-separated values representing the directions\n\nOutput Format\n\nPrint a single integer denoting minimum penalty incured\n\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\leq n,m \\leq 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa4104\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4 4\nR R R R\nD D D D\nL L L L\nT T T T\n2\nExplanation:\nChange the direction at (0,30,30,3) and (2,32,32,3) to DDD\nPath will be [0,00,00,0]->[0,10,10,1]-> [0,20,20,2]->[0,30,30,3]-> [1,31,31,3]->[2,32,32,3]->[3,33,33,3]'
