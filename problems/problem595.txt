b"Problem\nIt's the year 2050!2050!2050!, and the war has begun between aliens and humans. The aliens have\r\nplaced mines in the battlefield, where the battlefield can be described as grid of\r\nsize n\xe2\x88\x97mn*mn\xe2\x88\x97m, where nnn denotes the number of rows numbered from 111 to nnn from top to bottom and mmm denotes the number of columns numbered from 111 to mmm from left to right.\r\nHowever, the human army knows the positions of the mines denoted by (xxx,yyy) in the field\r\nand you being the commander have been assigned a task.\nThe task is described as follows:\nGiven the number of mines xxx (1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x97m)(1 \\leq x \\leq n*m)(1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x97m) and their respective positions in the grid consisting\r\nof binary values 000 or 111, where a value of 111 in cell ( iii , jjj ) ( 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n,1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4m1 \\leq i \\leq n , 1 \\leq j \\leq m1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n,1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4m ) denotes the presence of mine at\r\nposition (iii,jjj) and a value of 000 in cell (iii,jjj) denotes that the cell is free.\r\nSince the mines are quite heavy, the operation of relocating a mine is described as moving a\r\nmine to either of its neighbouring side cells or leaving the mine in its current position only,\r\nbut you can only perform this operation once for every ithithith mine 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4x1 \\leq i \\leq x1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4x, in other words you\r\ncan move a mine from it's current position denoted by ( xi,yix_{i},y_{i}xi\xe2\x80\x8b,yi\xe2\x80\x8b ) to either of the 555 positions - ( xi\xe2\x88\x921,yix_{i}-1,y_{i}xi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\x921,yi\xe2\x80\x8b ),\r\n( xi+1,yix_{i}+1,y_{i}xi\xe2\x80\x8b+1,yi\xe2\x80\x8b ) , ( xi,yi\xe2\x88\x921x_{i},y_{i}-1xi\xe2\x80\x8b,yi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\x921 ), ( xi,yi+1x_{i},y_{i}+1xi\xe2\x80\x8b,yi\xe2\x80\x8b+1 ), ( xi,yix_{i},y_{i}xi\xe2\x80\x8b,yi\xe2\x80\x8b ), such that the new position of the mine\r\nremains inside the field. A cell can contain multiple mines after relocation.\nSo, you need to relocate the mines in such a way that maximum number of cells\r\nget free in the battlefield, incurring minimum damage.\nNOTE:\nThe operation of relocating a mine from it's current position to either of the 555 positions such\r\nthat the new position of the mine remains inside the field can only be performed once for every\r\nmine.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nEach testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers n,mn, mn,m.\nThen next nnn lines contain mmm integers, either 0 or 1.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line, maximum number of cells\r\nget free in the battlefield.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4201 \\leq T \\leq 201\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa420\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa4401 \\leq n, m \\leq 401\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa440\nn\xe2\x88\x97m\xe2\x89\xa440 n*m \\leq 40n\xe2\x88\x97m\xe2\x89\xa440\n\nSample Input:\n2\r\n2 2 \r\n0 1 \r\n1 1 \r\n2 3 \r\n0 1 0 \r\n1 1 1 \n\nSample Output:\n3 \r\n5 \n"
