b"Problem\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.\nChef invented a new game named Quick Battle Royale. NNN people play the game. One or more rounds are played until all players except one are eliminated. In each round:\n\nLet there be xxx non-eliminated players at the start of the round. Let's number them 111 through xxx.\nFirst, each of these players chooses an integer between 111 and xxx inclusive. For each valid iii, let's denote the integer chosen by the iii-th player by pip_ipi\xe2\x80\x8b. In addition, each player is not allowed to choose pi=ip_i = ipi\xe2\x80\x8b=i. Under these conditions, all players choose uniformly randomly and independently.\nThen, the elimination process starts. For each iii from 111 to xxx, in this order:\n\nif the player iii is currently still in the game, the player pip_ipi\xe2\x80\x8b is eliminated from the game immediately\nif the player iii was already eliminated from the game in this round, nothing happens\n\n\n\nNote that it is impossible for all players to be eliminated and in each round, at least one player is eliminated.\nFor example, a game for N=4N = 4N=4 could look like this:\n\nRound 1: The players choose p1=3p_1 = 3p1\xe2\x80\x8b=3, p2=4p_2 = 4p2\xe2\x80\x8b=4, p3=2p_3 = 2p3\xe2\x80\x8b=2, p4=2p_4 = 2p4\xe2\x80\x8b=2. For i=1i = 1i=1, since player 111 is still in the game, player pi=3p_i = 3pi\xe2\x80\x8b=3 is eliminated. For i=2i = 2i=2, since player 222 is also in the game, player pi=4p_i = 4pi\xe2\x80\x8b=4 is eliminated. Since the players 333 and 444 are eliminated, nothing more happens.\nRound 2: Two players remain. The only choice they have is p1=2p_1 = 2p1\xe2\x80\x8b=2 and p2=1p_2 = 1p2\xe2\x80\x8b=1. For i=1i = 1i=1, since player 111 is still in the game, player pi=2p_i = 2pi\xe2\x80\x8b=2 gets eliminated. For i=2i = 2i=2, player 222 is eliminated, so nothing happens.\n\nNow there is one player left, so the game ends. It lasted 222 rounds.\nYou have to find the expected value of the number of rounds the game will last. It can be shown that the expected number of rounds can be written as a fraction pq\\frac{p}{q}qp\xe2\x80\x8b, where ppp and qqq are positive integers and qqq is coprime with 109+710^9+7109+7. You have to compute p\xe2\x8b\x85q\xe2\x88\x921p \\cdot q^{-1}p\xe2\x8b\x85q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 109+710^9 + 7109+7, where q\xe2\x88\x921q^{-1}q\xe2\x88\x921 is the multiplicative inverse of qqq modulo 109+710^9 + 7109+7.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single integer NNN denoting the number of players at the start of the game.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer p\xe2\x8b\x85q\xe2\x88\x921p \\cdot q^{-1}p\xe2\x8b\x85q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 109+710^9 + 7109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq T \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41002 \\leq N \\leq 1002\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n\nExample Input\n5\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\nExample Output\n0\n1\n500000005\n944444453\n616319451\n\nExplanation\nExample case 3: The answer is 32\\frac{3}{2}23\xe2\x80\x8b modulo (109+7)(10^9 + 7)(109+7). The following cases can happen in the first round (with equal probabilities):\n- p=[2,1,1]p = [2, 1, 1]p=[2,1,1], game lasts 111 round\n- p=[2,1,2]p = [2, 1, 2]p=[2,1,2], game lasts 222 rounds\n- p=[2,3,1]p = [2, 3, 1]p=[2,3,1], game lasts 111 round\n- p=[2,3,2]p = [2, 3, 2]p=[2,3,2], game lasts 222 rounds\n- p=[3,1,1]p = [3, 1, 1]p=[3,1,1], game lasts 111 round\n- p=[3,1,2]p = [3, 1, 2]p=[3,1,2], game lasts 111 round\n- p=[3,3,1]p = [3, 3, 1]p=[3,3,1], game lasts 222 rounds\n- p=[3,3,2]p = [3, 3, 2]p=[3,3,2], game lasts 222 rounds\nExample case 4: The answer is 3518\\frac{35}{18}1835\xe2\x80\x8b modulo (109+7)(10^9 + 7)(109+7)."
