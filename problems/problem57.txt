b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has a sequence of integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b. He takes a sheet of paper and for each non-empty subsequence BBB of this sequence, he does the following:\n\nFor each integer which appears in BBB, count its number of occurrences in the sequence BBB.\nChoose the integer with the largest number of occurrences. If there are several options, choose the smallest one.\nFinally, write down the chosen integer (an element of BBB) on the sheet of paper.\n\nFor each integer between 111 and NNN inclusive, find out how many times it appears on Chef's sheet of paper. Since these numbers may be very large, compute them modulo 1,000,000,0071,000,000,0071,000,000,007 (109+710^9 + 7109+7).\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing NNN space-separated integers. For each valid iii, the iii-th of these integers should be the number of occurrences of iii on Chef's sheet of paper.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le T \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le A_i \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid iii\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 500,000500,000500,000\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points): the sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 5,0005,0005,000\nSubtask #2 (10 points): A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b is a permutation of the integers 111 through NNN\nSubtask #3 (70 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n3\n2 2 3\n2\n1 2\n3\n1 2 20 6 1\n2 1\n3 4 0\nExplanation:\nExample case 3: There are 777 non-empty subsequences:\n\n[1][1][1] (Chef writes down 111)\n[2][2][2] (Chef writes down 222)\n[2][2][2] (Chef writes down 222)\n[1,2][1, 2][1,2] (Chef writes down 111)\n[1,2][1, 2][1,2] (Chef writes down 111)\n[2,2][2, 2][2,2] (Chef writes down 222)\n[1,2,2][1, 2, 2][1,2,2] (Chef writes down 222)\n"
