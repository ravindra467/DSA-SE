b"Problem\nYou are given a tree with NNN vertices. The vertices are numbered from 111 to NNN. Some of the vertices are colored black and some are colored red. Also, some vertices can be uncolored. There is at least one black and at least one red vertex.\nCompute the number of subsets of vertices WWW such that:\n\nEach vertex in WWW is uncolored.\nWWW is a connected subgraph of the tree.\nIf you remove all the vertices of set WWW, there will be at least one pair of vertices (u,v)(u, v)(u,v) such that uuu is black and vvv is red, and there is no path from uuu to vvv.\n\nOutput your answer modulo 109+710^{9} + 7109+7.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN denoting the number of vertices.\nEach of the next N\xe2\x88\x921N - 1N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two space-separated integers uuu and vvv denoting an edge between vertices uuu and vvv.\nThe next line contains NNN space-separated integers denoting the colors of the vertices. The ithi^{th}ith of these integers is 000 if vertex iii is uncolored, 111 if it's black, or 222 if it's red.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer denoting the number of ways to select a valid subset WWW, modulo 109+710^{9} + 7109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051 \\leq T \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^{5}1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41052 \\leq N \\leq 10^{5}2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq u, v \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\nSum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 10610^{6}106\n\nExample Input\n2\r\n6\r\n1 2\r\n1 3\r\n1 4\r\n3 5\r\n3 6\r\n0 1 0 1 2 0\r\n6\r\n1 2\r\n1 3\r\n1 4\r\n3 5\r\n3 6\r\n1 0 0 0 2 0\n\nExample Output\n5\r\n2\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 1: The possible subsets WWW are {1}\\{1\\}{1}, {3}\\{3\\}{3}, {1,3}\\{1, 3\\}{1,3}, {3,6}\\{3, 6\\}{3,6} and {1,3,6}\\{1, 3, 6\\}{1,3,6}.\nTest Case 2: The possible subsets WWW are {3}\\{3\\}{3} and {3,6}\\{3, 6\\}{3,6}."
