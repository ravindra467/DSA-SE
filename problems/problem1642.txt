b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nCodechef challenges have three divisions. In one challenge, there are NNN problems in each division, but some problems may be shared among multiple divisions. Each problem is uniquely identified by a code \xe2\x80\x94 a string containing only uppercase English letters. Each participant can only submit in one of the divisions.\nChef wants to find the number of correct solutions, in total among all 333 divisions, for each problem. Given a list of NNN problem codes with the numbers of correct solutions for each problem in each division, find the total number of correct solutions for each problem and sort them in non-decreasing order.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nNNN lines follow. For each valid iii, the iii-th of these lines contains a string S3,iS_{3,i}S3,i\xe2\x80\x8b followed by a space and an integer C3,iC_{3,i}C3,i\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x94 the problem code and the number of correct solutions on the iii-th problem in the third division.\nNNN more lines follow. For each valid iii, the iii-th of these lines contains a string S2,iS_{2,i}S2,i\xe2\x80\x8b followed by a space and an integer C2,iC_{2,i}C2,i\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x94 the problem code and the number of correct solutions on the iii-th problem in the second division.\nFinally, NNN more lines follow. For each valid iii, the iii-th of these lines contains a string S1,iS_{1,i}S1,i\xe2\x80\x8b followed by a space and an integer C1,iC_{1,i}C1,i\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x94 the problem code and the number of correct solutions on the iii-th problem in the first division.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, let PPP be the number of distinct problems; you should print PPP space-separated integers \xe2\x80\x94 the number of solutions for each of these problems, sorted in non-decreasing order.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq T \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851041 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3S1,i\xe2\x88\xa3,\xe2\x88\xa3S2,i\xe2\x88\xa3,\xe2\x88\xa3S3,i\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa481 \\leq |S_{1,i}|, |S_{2,i}|, |S_{3,i}| \\leq 81\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3S1,i\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\xa3,\xe2\x88\xa3S2,i\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\xa3,\xe2\x88\xa3S3,i\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa48 for each valid iii\nS1,i,S2,i,S3,iS_{1,i}, S_{2,i}, S_{3,i}S1,i\xe2\x80\x8b,S2,i\xe2\x80\x8b,S3,i\xe2\x80\x8b contain only uppercase English letters for each valid iii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4C1,i,C2,i,C3,i\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851081 \\leq C_{1,i}, C_{2,i}, C_{3,i} \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^81\xe2\x89\xa4C1,i\xe2\x80\x8b,C2,i\xe2\x80\x8b,C3,i\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85108 for each valid iii\nthe problem codes in each division are pairwise distinct, but some problem codes may appear in multiple divisions\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 10510^5105\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n1\nA 1\nB 2\nC 3\n2\nAA 1\nAB 1\nAB 1\nAC 1\nAC 1\nAD 1\n1\nZ 100\nZ 100\nZ 1001 2 3\n1 1 2 2\n300\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: There is only 111 problem in each division and no problems are shared among divisions, so the total number of distinct problems is 333 and the numbers of solutions are: 111 for "A", 222 for "B", 333 for "C".\nExample case 2: There are 222 problems in each division and each pair of consecutive divisions shares 111 problem, so the total number of distinct problems is 444 and the numbers of solutions are: 111 for "AA", 222 for "AB", 222 for "AC", 111 for "AD". We need to sort them in non-decreasing order, so the final answer is (1,1,2,2)(1, 1, 2, 2)(1,1,2,2).\nExample case 3: There is only 111 problem "Z" in the entire contest, shared among all divisions, and the number of solutions for it is 300300300.'
