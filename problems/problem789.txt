b"Problem\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nA sequence of integers is beautiful if each element of this sequence is divisible by 4.\nYou are given a sequence a1, a2, ..., an. In one step, you may choose any two elements of this sequence, remove them from the sequence and append their sum to the sequence. Compute the minimum number of steps necessary to make the given sequence beautiful.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer n.\nThe second line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one number \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of steps necessary to make the given sequence beautiful. If it's impossible to make the sequence beautiful, print -1 instead.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 sum of n over all test cases \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 ai \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n7\n1 2 3 1 2 3 83"
