b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Russian and Mandarin Chinese.\nFind the minimum integer KKK such that sum of bits present on odd positions in binary representation of all integers from 111 to KKK is greater than or equal to NNN.\nThe bits are enumerated from left to right starting from the leftmost set bit i.e. the most significant bit. For example, binary representation of 777777 is 1001101. Bits present on 1st1^{st}1st, 3rd3^{rd}3rd, 5th5^{th}5th and 7th7^{th}7th positions in the binary representation are 1,0,1,11, 0, 1, 11,0,1,1 respectively. So sum of bits present on odd positions in binary representation of 777777 is 1+0+1+1=31 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 31+0+1+1=3.\nInput Format\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nEach testcase contains of a single line of input, an integer NNN.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each testcase, output in a single line the minimum possible value of KKK.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\leq T \\leq 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq N \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n2\n6\n1002\n5\n57\nExplanation:\n\nIn the first test case, binary representations of 111 and 222 are 1, 10. Sum of bits present on odd positions in the binary representation of 111 and 222 =  1+11 + 11+1 = 222.\nIn the second test case, the binary representations of integers from 111 to 555 are 1, 10,\n11, 100, 101 respectively. So the sum of bits present on odd positions in binary\nrepresentation of integers from 111 to 555 are 1,1,1,1,21, 1, 1, 1, 21,1,1,1,2 respectively which makes a total of 666.\n'
