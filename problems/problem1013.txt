b'Problem\nSteve is in a fight with Hydra. He has nnn gun shots. He has to kill the enemy in order to rule their territory. But, he can only fire 111 or 222 shots at each move. He also wants the number of moves to be a multiple of an integer kkk otherwise the gun will explode.\nHelp Steve to find the minimal number of moves to win the battle against Hydra by following the conditions given.\n\nInput:\nFirst line contains TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nEach testcase contains two space separated integers nnn, kkk.\nNote: Input file can be empty\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output an integer i.e. minimal number of moves being a multiple of kkk. If there is no way he can win the battle by following the condition, print \xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921.\n\nConstraints\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\leq T \\leq 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\leq n \\leq 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq k \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa410\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1(100 points): Original Constraints\n\nSample Input:\n2\n10 2\n3 5\n\nSample Output:\n6\n-1\n\nEXPLANATION:\nFor the first case, Steve could win the battle in 6 moves with following sequence of steps: {2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1}. \nFor the second test, there are only three valid sequence of steps {2, 1}, {1, 2}, {1, 1, 1} with 2, 2, and 3 steps respectively. All these numbers are not multiples of 5.'
