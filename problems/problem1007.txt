b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChefina gave Chef a sequence F1,F2,\xe2\x80\xa6,FNF_1, F_2, \\ldots, F_NF1\xe2\x80\x8b,F2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,FN\xe2\x80\x8b as a birthday present. She constructed it from a sequence of positive integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b in the following way: for each valid iii, Fi=\xe2\x88\x91j=1i(\xe2\x88\x921)(j+1)\xe2\x8b\x85AjF_i = \\sum_{j=1}^i (-1)^{(j+1)} \\cdot A_jFi\xe2\x80\x8b=\xe2\x88\x91j=1i\xe2\x80\x8b(\xe2\x88\x921)(j+1)\xe2\x8b\x85Aj\xe2\x80\x8b.\nUnfortunately, Chef was playing with the sequence FFF and shuffled it. Now, he has a sequence denoted by BBB, but he does not remember FFF. The only things he knows are that FFF is a permutation of BBB and among all such permutations which Chefina could have constructed, her sequence FFF was the lexicographically smallest.\nChef does not want to disappoint Chefina, but he is too busy in the kitchen, so he asked you to help him recover FFF. Find the sequence FFF he got from Chefina or determine that he made another mistake and a sequence that satisfies the given conditions does not exist.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BNB_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_NB1\xe2\x80\x8b,B2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case:\n\nIf there is no solution, print a single line containing the string "NO" (without quotes).\nOtherwise, print two lines.\nThe first of these lines should contain the string "YES" (without quotes).\nThe second line should contain NNN space-separated integers F1,F2,\xe2\x80\xa6,FNF_1, F_2, \\ldots, F_NF1\xe2\x80\x8b,F2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,FN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410,0001 \\le T \\le 10,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le N \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\xe2\x88\xa3Bi\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4109|B_i| \\le 10^9\xe2\x88\xa3Bi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid iii\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 10610^6106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points): B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BNB_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_NB1\xe2\x80\x8b,B2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN\xe2\x80\x8b are pairwise distinct\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4\n2\n1 2\n3\n-1 -2 -3\n4\n3 3 3 4\n4\n4 -4 4 -4YES\n2 1\nNO\nNO\nYES\n4 -4 4 -4\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: The only two permutations of BBB are [1,2][1,2][1,2] and [2,1][2,1][2,1]. Out of them, [1,2][1,2][1,2] could not have been generated by Chefina, since it would require A=[1,\xe2\x88\x921]A = [1,-1]A=[1,\xe2\x88\x921], which contains a negative element. On the other hand, for [2,1][2,1][2,1], we get A=[2,1]A = [2,1]A=[2,1], so F=[2,1]F = [2,1]F=[2,1] must be the sequence Chefina generated.'
