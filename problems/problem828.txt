b"Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nDevu is a class teacher of a class of n students. One day, in the morning prayer of the school, all the students of his class were standing in a line. You are given information of their arrangement by a string s. The string s consists of only letters 'B' and 'G', where 'B' represents a boy and 'G' represents a girl.\nDevu wants inter-gender interaction among his class should to be maximum. So he does not like seeing two or more boys/girls standing nearby (i.e. continuous) in the line. e.g. he does not like the arrangements BBG and GBB, but he likes BG, GBG etc.\nNow by seeing the initial arrangement s of students, Devu may get furious and now he wants to change this arrangement into a likable arrangement. For achieving that, he can swap positions of any two students (not necessary continuous). Let the cost of swapping people from position i with position j (i \xe2\x89\xa0 j) be c(i, j). You are provided an integer variable type, then the cost of the the swap will be defined by c(i, j) = |j \xe2\x88\x92 i|type.\nPlease help Devu in finding minimum cost of swaps needed to convert the current arrangement into a likable one.\nInput\nThe first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases are follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer type, denoting the type of the cost function. Then the next line contains string s of length n, denoting the initial arrangement s of students.\nNote that the integer n is not given explicitly in input.\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the answer of the test case, that is, the minimum cost to convert the current arrangement into a likable one. If it is not possible to convert the current arrangement into a likable one, then print -1 instead of the minimum cost.\nConstraints and Subtasks\nSubtask 1: 25 points\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 105\ntype = 0\nSum of n over all the test cases in one test file does not exceed 106.\nSubtask 2: 25 points\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 105\ntype = 1\nSum of n over all the test cases in one test file does not exceed 106.\nSubtask 3: 25 points\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 105\ntype = 2\nSum of n over all the test cases in one test file does not exceed 106.\nSubtask 4: 25 points\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 102\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 103\ntype can be 0, 1 or 2, that is type \xe2\x88\x88 {0, 1, 2}.Note type of the first 3 test cases is 0. So c(i, j) = 1. Hence we just have to count minimum number of swaps needed.\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput8\n0\nBB\n0\nBG\n0\nBBGG\n1\nBGG\n1\nBGGB\n1\nBBBGG\n2\nBBGG\n2\nBGB-1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n3\n1\n0\nExplanation:\nExample case 1. There is no way to make sure that both the boys does not stand nearby. So answer is -1.\nExample case 2. Arrangement is already valid. No swap is needed. So answer is 0.\nExample case 3. Swap boy at position 1 with girl at position 2. After swap the arrangement will be BGBG which is a valid arrangement. So answer is 1.\nNow type of the next 3 test cases is 1. So c(i, j) = |j ? i|, that is, the absolute value of the difference between i and j.\nExample case 4. Swap boy at position 0 with girl at position 1. After swap the arrangement will be GBG which is a valid arrangement. So answer is |1 - 0| = 1.\nExample case 5. Swap boy at position 0 with girl at position 1. After swap the arrangement will be GBGB which is a valid arrangement. So answer is |1 - 0| = 1.\nExample case 6. Swap boy at position 1 with girl at position 4. After swap the arrangement will be BGBGB which is a valid arrangement. So answer is |4 - 1| = 3.\nThen type of the last 2 test cases is 2. So c(i, j) = (j ? i)2\nExample case 7. Swap boy at position 1 with girl at position 2. After swap the arrangement will be BGBG which is a valid arrangement. So answer is (2 - 1)2 = 1.\nExample case 8. Arrangement is already valid. No swap is needed. So answer is 0."
