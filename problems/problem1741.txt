b'Problem\nYour school has ordered some equipment that has been delivered in a number of very heavy cartons. Each carton has a serial number SSS and the cartons are all lined up in a row. Unfortunately, your teacher asked for the cartons to be placed in a particular sequence and you forgot to tell the people who unloaded the cartons about this. You now have to quickly restore the cartons to the correct order before the teacher comes and sees how you have messed up her instructions.\nSince the cartons are very heavy, you cannot carry them over long distances. In each step, all you can do is to exchange the position of two adjacent cartons.\nFor instance, suppose the serial numbers on the cartons in the order in which they are unloaded are 34,29,12,78,9034, 29, 12, 78, 9034,29,12,78,90 and the order in which the cartons were supposed to be arranged is 90,29,78,34,1290, 29, 78, 34, 1290,29,78,34,12. These cartons can be rearranged in the desired order with 7 exchanges, as follows:\n\n\nExchange 78,9078, 9078,90 \xe2\x80\x94 34,29,12,90,7834, 29, 12, 90, 7834,29,12,90,78\n\n\nExchange 12,9012, 9012,90 \xe2\x80\x94 34,29,90,12,7834, 29, 90, 12, 7834,29,90,12,78\n\n\nExchange 34,2934, 2934,29 \xe2\x80\x94 29,34,90,12,7829, 34, 90, 12, 7829,34,90,12,78\n\n\nExchange 12,7812, 7812,78 \xe2\x80\x94 29,34,90,78,1229, 34, 90, 78, 1229,34,90,78,12\n\n\nExchange 34,9034, 9034,90 \xe2\x80\x94 29,90,34,78,1229, 90, 34, 78, 1229,90,34,78,12\n\n\nExchange 29,9029, 9029,90 \xe2\x80\x94 90,29,34,78,1290, 29, 34, 78, 1290,29,34,78,12\n\n\nExchange 34,7834, 7834,78 \xe2\x80\x94 90,29,78,34,1290, 29, 78, 34, 1290,29,78,34,12\n\n\nIn this example, it can be shown that 777 exchanges are needed to reorder the cartons as desired.\nClearly, you want to get the job done with minimum e\xef\xac\x80ort. Given the initial arrangement of the cartons and the \xef\xac\x81nal sequence that the teacher wants, your goal is to compute the minimum number of exchanges required to rearrange the cartons in the desired order.\nInput Format\n\nThe \xef\xac\x81rst line of input is a single integer NNN, the total number of cartons.\nThe second line consists of NNN distinct positive integers, separated by spaces, denoting the serial numbers of the NNN cartons in the order in which they were unloaded.\nThe third line is another sequence of NNN integers, denoting the desired order in which the NNN cartons should be rearranged. The sequence of numbers in the third line is guaranteed to be a permutation of the sequence in the second line.\n\nOutput Format\nThe output should be a single integer, the minimum number of exchanges required to achieve the desired sequence of cartons.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851091 \\leq S \\leq 2\\cdot10^91\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85109\n\n\nSubtasks\n\n\nSubtask 1 (90 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa460001 \\leq N \\leq 60001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa46000\nSubtask 2 (10 points): Original constraints.\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput5\n34 29 12 78 90 \n90 29 78 34 127\n\nExplanation:\nExplained in Statement'
