There are two rounds (round A and round B) after the qualification round. From both of them, teams can qualify to the pre-elimination round. According to the rules, in each of these two rounds, teams are sorted in descending order by their score and each team with a score greater or equal to the score of the team at the K=1500K=1500K=1500-th place advances to the pre-elimination round (this means it is possible to have more than KKK qualified teams from each round in the case of one or more ties after the KKK-th place).\nToday, the organizers ask you to count the number of teams which would qualify for the pre-elimination round from round A for a given value of KKK (possibly different from 150015001500). They provided the scores of all teams to you; you should ensure that all teams scoring at least as many points as the KKK-th team qualify.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and KKK.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers S1,S2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SNS_1, S_2, \\dots, S_NS1\xe2\x80\x8b,S2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,SN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of qualified teams.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le T \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le K \\le N \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Si\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\le S_i \\le 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Si\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid iii\nthe sum of NNN for all test cases does not exceed 10610^6106\n\nExample Input\n2\n5 1\n3 5 2 4 5\n6 4\n6 5 4 3 2 1\n\nExample Output\n2\n4\n'
