b"Problem\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nChef has NNN small boxes arranged on a line from 111 to NNN. For each valid iii, the weight of the iii-th box is WiW_iWi\xe2\x80\x8b. Chef wants to bring them to his home, which is at the position 000. He can hold any number of boxes at the same time; however, the total weight of the boxes he's holding must not exceed K at any time, and he can only pick the ith box if all the boxes between Chef's home and the ith box have been either moved or picked up in this trip.\nTherefore, Chef will pick up boxes and carry them home in one or more round trips. Find the smallest number of round trips he needs or determine that he cannot bring all boxes home.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and KKK.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers W1,W2,\xe2\x80\xa6,WNW_1, W_2, \\ldots, W_NW1\xe2\x80\x8b,W2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,WN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the smallest number of round trips or \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible for Chef to bring all boxes home.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le T \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\le N, K \\le 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Wi\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\le W_i \\le 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4Wi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4103 for each valid iii\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4\n1 1 \n2\n2 4\n1 1\n3 6\n3 4 2\n3 6\n3 4 3-1\n1\n2\n3\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: Since the weight of the box higher than KKK, Chef can not carry that box home in any number of the round trip.\nExample case 2: Since the sum of weights of both boxes is less than KKK, Chef can carry them home in one round trip.\nExample case 3: In the first round trip, Chef can only pick up the box at position 111. In the second round trip, he can pick up both remaining boxes at positions 222 and 333.\nExample case 4: Chef can only carry one box at a time, so three round trips are required."
