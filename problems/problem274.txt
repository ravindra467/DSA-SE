b'Problem\n\n King of Chefland is very crurcial and coward. Chef is one of the soldiers of the king. Chef is brave and very powerful soldier. This is the reason that king is affraid of Chef. So, he trapped Chef in prison.\n\n\n Chef is kept in a special jail with tight security. There are MxNM x NMxN(MMM rows and NNN columns) rooms in the jail and walls the room are made of stone. It is not possible to break the walls. If a person standing in room (i,j)(i, j)(i,j) then he can walk to room (i,j+1),(i+1,j)(i, j+1), (i+1, j)(i,j+1),(i+1,j) and (i+1,j+1) (i+1, j+1)(i+1,j+1).\n\n\n Chef is kept in room (1,1)(1,1)(1,1) and rest of the rooms having soldiers, it means there are (M\xe2\x88\x97N\xe2\x88\x921)(M*N-1)(M\xe2\x88\x97N\xe2\x88\x921) soldiers in the jail for security. Each soldier SiS_iSi\xe2\x80\x8b is having some power PiP_{i}Pi\xe2\x80\x8b. King ordered his soldier that they must kill Chef if he tries to escape. Chef has also some power P0P_0P0\xe2\x80\x8b. There is a drain in the jail in position (x,y)(x,y)(x,y). Chef can escape from the jail if he can win all the soldiers which come in the path of Chef. Chef will win and escape only if the sum of power of soldier is less than equal to Chef power in the chosen path.\n Now you need to find that chef can escape or not. \n\n For example : \n1013105151724269867\n\nPower of the Chef is P0=10P_0=10P0\xe2\x80\x8b=10 and position of the drain is (x,y)=(3,3)(x,y)=(3,3)(x,y)=(3,3). So he can choose either path\n\n 1+3+1+2=7\xe2\x89\xa4101+ 3 + 1+ 2 = 7 \\leq 101+3+1+2=7\xe2\x89\xa410. If Chef follow the path (1,2),(1,3),(2,3),(3,3)(1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)(1,2),(1,3),(2,3),(3,3)\n 1+1+2=4\xe2\x89\xa4101+ 1 + 2 = 4 \\leq 101+1+2=4\xe2\x89\xa410. If Chef follow the path (1,2),(2,3),(3,3)(1,2), (2,3), (3,3)(1,2),(2,3),(3,3)\nIt means Chef can escape from the jail.\n\nInput:\n\n First line will contain TTT, number of testcases.
