b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nIn Chef Rami's kitchen, there is a long counter divided into NNN sections (numbered 111 through NNN). For each valid iii, there are aia_iai\xe2\x80\x8b raw meals stacked on top of each other in section iii.\nChef Rami has a special cooking device. This device can take all the meals that are stacked in some section and instantly cook them. He may perform the following operations in any order any number of times (including zero), until all the meals are cooked:\n\nChoose a section and use the device to cook all the meals in that section. This move costs XXX units of energy regardless of which section it is applied to.\nChoose a section iii (i\xe2\x89\xa52i \\ge 2i\xe2\x89\xa52) and move all the meals that are located in section iii on top of the meals in section i\xe2\x88\x921i-1i\xe2\x88\x921 (if there are 000 meals in section i\xe2\x88\x921i-1i\xe2\x88\x921, all the meals from section iii are simply moved). The cost of this move is the number of meals located in section iii before the move.\nChoose a section iii (i<Ni \\lt Ni<N) and move all the meals that are located in section iii on top of the meals in section i+1i+1i+1. The cost of this move is also the number of meals located in section iii before the move.\n\nSince Chef Rami is lazy, he wants to spend the minimum amount of energy to cook all the meals. Help him calculate this value.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and XXX.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aNa_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_Na1\xe2\x80\x8b,a2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,aN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum number of units of energy Chef Rami needs to spend.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le T \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45,0001 \\le N \\le 5,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\le X \\le 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4109\n0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41090 \\le a_i \\le 10^90\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid iii\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 20,00020,00020,000\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4501 \\le N \\le 501\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa450\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 500500500\n\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n3 3\n5 2 48\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: One of the optimal solutions is to move all the meals from the second section to the third section, with cost 222, and then use the device on the first and third sections, with cost 333 units of energy per use. The total cost is 2+3+3=82+3+3 = 82+3+3=8 units of energy."
