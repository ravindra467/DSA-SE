b'Problem\nChefina  is  always interested to play with string. But due to exam pressure she has no time to solve a string problem. She wants your help. Can you help her to solve that problem?\nYou are given a string. You have to find out the WonderWonderWonder SumSumSum of the string. WonderWonderWonder SumSumSum of a string is defined as the sum of the value of each character of the string.\r\nThe value of each character means:\n\nIf the string is started with "a" , then the value of each character of the string is like "a"=100, "b"=101, "c"="102" ........."z"=125.\nIf the string is started with "z" , then the value of each character of the string is like "a"=2600, "b"=2601, "c"="2602" ........."z"=2625.\n\nSince even the WonderWonderWonder SumSumSum can be large, output WonderWonderWonder SumSumSum modulo  (109+710^9 + 7109+7).\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nEach testcase contains of a single line of input, a string SSS with lower case alphabet\r\nonly.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line integer i.e.  WonderWonderWonder SumSumSum modulo  (109+710^9 + 7109+7).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq T \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq |S| \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\nSample Input:\n$2$\r\n$cab$\n\nsdefsdefsdef\nSample Output:\n$903$\n\n763076307630\nEXPLANATION:\ni) For the first test case, since the string is started with "ccc", so output is (302302302+300300300+301301301)=903903903\nii)For the second test case, since the string is started with "sss", so output is (191819181918+190319031903+190419041904+190519051905)=763076307630'
