b'Problem\nChef wants to teach a lesson of sharing to the students.\nThere are NNN students (numbered from 111 to NNN from left to right) who are asked to stand in a row. Initially Chef gave AAAiii candies to the iiiththth child. In one operation any child can give any number of candies to the child standing to his immediate left (i.e. iiiththth child can give any amount of candies to the (i\xe2\x88\x921)(i-1)(i\xe2\x88\x921)ththth child. In particular 1st child cannot give his candies to anyone).\nHe asked them to minimize the maximum value of candies a student can possess after performing any number of operations (possibly zero).\nHelp the students finding such maximum value.\nInput:\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nFirst line of each test case contains a single integer NNN denoting the number of students.\nSecond line contains NNN space-separated integers AAA111,AAA222,............... AAANNN denoting the initial amount of candies chef gave to them.\n\nOutput:\n\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 maximum value after sharing.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq T \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n000 \xe2\x89\xa4\\leq\xe2\x89\xa4 AAAiii \xe2\x89\xa4\\leq\xe2\x89\xa4 10910^9109\nSum of NNN over all Test Cases does not exceed 10510^5105\n\nSample Input\n2 \n5 \n1 2 3 4 5 \n5\n5 4 3 2 1\n\nSample Output\n3 \n5  \n\nExplanation\n\n\nFor First Test Case:\nThe 555ththth student will give 222 candies to 444ththth student and 444ththth will give 333 candies to 333rdrdrd and 333rdrdrd will give 333 candies to 222ndndnd and 222ndndnd will give 222 candies to 111ststst. So finally the number of candies that they will have are\n[3,3,3,3,3][3,3,3,3,3][3,3,3,3,3] and the value of maximum candies is 333.\n\n\nFor Second Test Case:\nSharing to the left student will not change the maximum value as 111ststst cannot share to anyone. So the maximum value will remain 555.\n\n'
