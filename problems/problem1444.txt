b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a rooted tree with NNN nodes (numbered 111 through NNN; node 111 is the root). For each iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x9211 \\le i \\le N-11\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x921), the parent of the node i+1i+1i+1 is pip_ipi\xe2\x80\x8b.\nYou need to answer QQQ queries. (Sounds quite familiar!) For each query, first, WWW tasks are given to node VVV. These tasks are processed in the tree in the following way:\n\nWhen a node receives aaa tasks and it has no children, all aaa tasks are executed by this node.\nOtherwise, i.e. if the node has K>0K \\gt 0K>0 children, where KKK is a divisor of aaa, then this node gives a/Ka/Ka/K of these tasks to each of its children. This process is performed recursively by each child on the tasks it receives.\nOtherwise, i.e. if the node has K>0K \\gt 0K>0 children, but KKK is not a divisor of aaa, all aaa tasks are ignored and none of this node's children receive any tasks.\n\nFor each query, find the number of tasks that are not executed, i.e. end up ignored, possibly after passing down the tree.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer NNN.\nThe second line contains N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 space-separated integers p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pN\xe2\x88\x921p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_{N-1}p1\xe2\x80\x8b,p2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,pN\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x80\x8b.\nThe third line contains a single integer QQQ.\nQQQ lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers VVV and WWW describing a query.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the number of tasks that are not executed.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N, Q \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le p_i \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid iii\nthe graph described on the input is a tree\n1\xe2\x89\xa4V\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq V \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4V\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4W\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\leq W \\leq 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4W\xe2\x89\xa4106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points): N\xe2\x89\xa4100N \\leq 100N\xe2\x89\xa4100\nSubtask #2 (80 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput5\n1 1 2 2\n2\n1 10\n1 205\n0"
