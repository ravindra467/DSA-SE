b"Problem\nRead problems statements Mandarin , Bengali , Hindi , Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef's brother Chefu is a competitive programmer. Every day, he practices for ICPC (International Chefs' Programming Contest) by solving problems. Today, Chef challenged his brother to solve a certain problem, promising to bake an apple pie for him if he succeeds. Chefu has successfully solved the problem, but can you solve it?\nYou are given an integer sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b. In one move, you must select two adjacent elements of this sequence (i.e. AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b and Ai+1A_{i+1}Ai+1\xe2\x80\x8b for some valid iii) and swap them. Let's call a sequence orderly if it contains a contiguous subsequence with length at least KKK such that all of its elements have identical values. Find the minimum number of moves required to make the given sequence orderly or determine that it is impossible.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and KKK.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum required number of moves, or \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible to make the sequence orderly.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le T \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4300,0002 \\le K \\le N \\le 300,0002\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4300,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4300,0001 \\le A_i \\le 300,0001\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4300,000 for each valid iii\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 10610^6106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points):\n\nN\xe2\x89\xa4100N \\le 100N\xe2\x89\xa4100\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 1,0001,0001,000\n\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n8 3\n1 2 2 1 3 3 2 1\n5 3\n1 1 2 2 33\n-1"
