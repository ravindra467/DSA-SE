b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.\nAn array AAA consisting of NNN integers is called KKK-beautiful if it holds the following property:\nThe number of adjacent indices with different values is at most KKK. More formally, there are at most KKK indices iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i<N1\\le i\\lt N1\xe2\x89\xa4i<N) such that Ai\xe2\x89\xa0Ai+1A_i\\ne A_{i+1}Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xee\x80\xa0=Ai+1\xe2\x80\x8b. Note that according to this definition, if an array AAA is KKK-beautiful, then AAA is also (K+1)(K+1)(K+1)-beautiful.\nYou are given an array AAA consisting of NNN integers and an integer KKK. Find the length of the longest KKK-beautiful subsequence of AAA, where a subsequence is defined below.\nFor example, consider the array A=[1,1,2,3,2,4]A = [1 , 1, 2, 3, 2 , 4]A=[1,1,2,3,2,4]. The subsequences [1,1][1, 1][1,1] and [1,1,2][1, 1, 2][1,1,2] are 111-beautiful, and the subsequences [1,2,3][1, 2, 3][1,2,3] and [1,2,2,4][1, 2, 2, 4][1,2,2,4] are 222-beautiful.\nNote: A sequence aaa is a subsequence of a sequence bbb if aaa can be obtained from bbb by deletion of several (possibly, zero) elements. For example, [3,1][3,1][3,1] is a subsequence of [3,2,1][3,2,1][3,2,1] and [4,3,1][4,3,1][4,3,1], but not a subsequence of [1,3,3,7][1,3,3,7][1,3,3,7] and [3,10,4][3,10,4][3,10,4].\nInput Format\nThe first line contains an integer TTT - the number of test cases. Then TTT test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers NNN, KKK - the length of array AAA and the parameter for a beautiful sequence.\nThe second line of each testcase contains NNN integers A1,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1,\\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b.\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output the maximum possible length of a KKK-beautiful subsequence of AAA.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq T \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\leq N \\leq 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\leq K \\leq 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4103\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4\n4 1\n1 1 2 3\n9 2\n1 2 3 2 4 5 6 7 5\n5 5\n1 1 1 1 1\n10 1\n1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2\n3\n5\n5\n6\nExplanation:\n\n\nTest Case 1 : You can either choose [1,1,2][1, 1, 2][1,1,2] or [1,1,3][1, 1, 3][1,1,3] as a subsequence. Both of the subsequences are 111-beautiful. So the maximum length of a 111-beautiful subsequence is 333.\n\n\nTest Case 2 : It is optimal to choose the subsequence [1,2,2,5,5][1, 2, 2, 5, 5][1,2,2,5,5]. So the maximum length of a 222-beautiful subsequence is 555.\n\n\nTest Case 3 : You can choose the entire array as a subsequence because the given array is KKK-beautiful for any K\xe2\x89\xa50K\\ge 0K\xe2\x89\xa50, which includes K=5K=5K=5.\n\n'
