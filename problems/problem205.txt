b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nAbdullah has recently moved to Tolland. In Tolland, there are NNN cities (numbered 111 through NNN) connected by N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 bidirectional roads such that it is possible to visit any city from any other city. For each city iii, there is a toll value TLiTL_iTLi\xe2\x80\x8b.\nAbdullah lives in city XXX. He has planned a tour of Tolland lasting for 2N2N2N days. For each iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le i \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), on the 2i\xe2\x88\x9212i-12i\xe2\x88\x921-th day, he travels from city XXX to city iii, and on the 2i2i2i-th day, he travels from city iii back to city XXX.\nIn Tolland, there are also special discount coupons. For each city ccc and positive integer vvv, there is a discount coupon for city ccc with value vvv. All discount coupons may be bought anywhere in Tolland; the cost of each discount coupon is twice its value.\nWhen travelling from any city iii to any (not necessarily different) city jjj, Abdullah must pay a toll exactly once in each city on the path between them (including iii and jjj); even if he passed through some cities before, he must pay the toll in these cities as well. For any city iii, the toll is TLiTL_iTLi\xe2\x80\x8b when not using any discount coupons; however, if Abdullah bought some discount coupons for city iii, he may use some or all of them to decrease this toll to max\xe2\x80\x89(0,TLi\xe2\x88\x92V)\\mathrm{max}\\,(0, TL_i-V)max(0,TLi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\x92V), where VVV is the sum of values of coupons for city iii used by Abdullah. Each coupon may be used at most once per day, but they do not expire when used and the same coupon may be used on multiple days. On each day, Abdullah may use any coupons he wants, but a coupon for city iii may only be used to decrease the toll in city iii.\nAbdullah has a travel budget: on each day, he must not spend more than KKK units of money on paying tolls. Before the start of the tour, he may choose to buy any number of discount coupons, for any cities and with any values (possibly different ones for different cities); the cost of coupons is not included in the budget for any day of the tour. Help Abdullah find the minimum total amount of money he must spend on discount coupons so that on each day during the tour, he will be able to stay within his budget by using the coupons he bought.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NNN, XXX and KKK.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers TL1,TL2,\xe2\x80\xa6,TLNTL_1, TL_2, \\ldots, TL_NTL1\xe2\x80\x8b,TL2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,TLN\xe2\x80\x8b.\nEach of the next N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two space-separated integers UUU and VVV denoting that cities UUU and VVV are connected by a bidirectional road.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum amount of money Abdullah should spend on coupons.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le T \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\le N \\le 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa410131 \\le K \\le 10^{13}1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41013\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X,U,V\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le X, U, V \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4X,U,V\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4TLi\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\le TL_i \\le 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4TLi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid iii\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (40 points):\n\neach city is directly connected to at most two other cities\ncity XXX is directly connected to at most one city\n\nSubtask #2 (60 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n4 2 6\n4 7 6 2\n2 1\n2 3\n2 4\n3 1 8\n2 3 1\n1 2\n2 314\n0\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: The total costs of tolls on each day without purchasing any discount coupons would be [11,11,7,7,13,13,9,9][11, 11, 7, 7, 13, 13, 9, 9][11,11,7,7,13,13,9,9].\nThe budget 666 is exceeded on each day of the tour. However, Abdullah can buy a discount coupon with value 555 for city 222 and a discount coupon with value 222 for city 333. The total cost of these coupons is 5\xe2\x8b\x852+2\xe2\x8b\x852=145 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 2 = 145\xe2\x8b\x852+2\xe2\x8b\x852=14. Now, the costs of tolls on each day are [6,6,2,2,6,6,4,4][6, 6, 2, 2, 6, 6, 4, 4][6,6,2,2,6,6,4,4], and the budget is never exceeded.\nExample case 2: The costs of tolls on each day without purchasing any discount coupons would be [2,2,5,5,6,6][2, 2, 5, 5, 6, 6][2,2,5,5,6,6]. Since the budget is already never exceeded, there is no need to buy any discount coupons.'
