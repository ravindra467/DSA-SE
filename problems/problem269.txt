b"Problem\nThe Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv very likes coins. But most of all he likes colored coins.\nHe has N types of coins, numbered from 1 to N, inclusive. The coin of the i-th type has the value Vi dollars and the color Ci. Note that he has infinite supply of each type of coins.\nThe Little Elephant wants to make exactly S dollars using the coins. What is the maximal number of different colors he can use to make exactly S dollars using some of the coins he has? If it's impossible, output -1. Also note that the Little Elephant wants to know this for many values of S.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer N, denoting the number of types of coins. Each of the following N lines contains two space-separated integers Vi and Ci, denoting the value and the color of the coin of the i-th type. The next line contains a single integer Q, denoting the number of values of S to process. Each of the following Q lines contains a single integer S, denoting the coinage you should represent via given coins using maximum number of colors.\nOutput\nFor each value of S in the input, output the maximum number of different colors in the representation of S or -1 if it is impossible to represent S via given coins.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 30\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Vi \xe2\x89\xa4 200000 (2 * 105)\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ci \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xe2\x89\xa4 200000 (2 * 105)\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 S \xe2\x89\xa4 1018\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n2 1\n3 4\n4 4\n4\n1\n3\n5\n7\nOutput:\n-1\n1\n2\n2\n\nExplanation\nIt is not possible to represent S = 1 since every coin has value more than 1.\nS = 3 can only be represented using one coin of the second type, hence only one color is used in the representation.\nS = 5 can only be represented as 2 + 3, which leads to two colors used.\nFor S = 7 we have two representations as 2 + 2 + 3 (with two colors used) and 3 + 4 (with one color used). Hence, the answer is 2."
