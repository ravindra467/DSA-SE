b"Problem\nCorruption is on the rise in the country of Freedonia, Gru's home.\nThis corruption network can be represented in the form of a tree having NNN nodes and N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 edges. The nodes are numbered from 111 to NNN, and the tree is rooted at node 111. These nodes represent the corrupt officials and each corrupt official works under some other corrupt official (except the Boss, who is represented by node 111).\nGru believes in divide and conquer and thinks that this network needs to be divided into as many sub-networks as possible. To achieve this, the following operation can be applied by the minions any number of times (even 0):\nIn one operation, the minions can select any one leaf node official (that is, an official who does not have any other official beneath him) in the graph and kill him along with all his ancestors. This operation deletes those nodes, along with all of their edges/connections from the graph. Hence after applying this operation on any tree, it breaks into some connected components which are also trees, which are the new sub-networks.\nNow the minions are a bit lazy and will do the task someday, but they need to submit a report to Gru as soon as possible. Help the minions by finding out the maximum number of connected components that can be achieved.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain NNN, number of nodes in the tree.\nNext N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains 2 integers UUU, VVV denoting the endpoints of the ithi^{th}ith edge.\n\nOutput:\n\nPrint the maximum number of connected components you can obtain after doing the operation any number of times.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\leq N \\leq 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4U,V\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq U,V \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4U,V\xe2\x89\xa4N\n\nSample Input:\n7\r\n1 2\r\n1 3\r\n2 4\r\n2 5\r\n3 6\r\n3 7\n\nSample Output:\n2\n\nEXPLANATION:\nWe have 444 leaf nodes in this tree: 444 555 666 777.\nSuppose we delete nodes 555, 222, and 111. After these deletions we are left with 222 trees -\n\nOne consisting of only node 444\nOne consisting of nodes 333, 666, and 777\n\nThis can also be achieved by deleting any of the other leaf nodes, and it can be proven that we cannot obtain more than 222 connected components in this example."
