b'Problem\nMr. Vasu being one of the top coders in his college was given the responsibility to organize a coding contest for NIT Kurukshetra\xe2\x80\x99s tech festival. Although he was very good at solving questions, he found that it was a much harder task to make questions. The contest\xe2\x80\x99s date was coming close and he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come up with any problems. Finally, Mr. Vasu decides to copy questions from a website to make the contest (not a decision he was very proud of).\nThe website has NNN number of questions. Each of the questions has a difficulty rating associated with it. The ith question has a difficulty DiD_iDi\xe2\x80\x8b. You are given a list of the difficulty rating of all the questions. Vasu has to select QQQ questions out of them (2\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4N2 \\leq Q \\leq N2\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4N). He wants the minimum rating difference between any two questions out of all the questions that he selected should be maximized.\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains a single integer NNN, denoting the number of questions\nThe second line contains QQQ which denotes the number of questions Vasu has to pick.\nThe third line contains NNN space-separated integers in ascending order denoting the difficulty rating of the question.\n\nOutput:\nPrint the largest minimum rating difference between any two questions selected by Vasu.\nConstraints\n\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41062 \\leq N \\leq 10^62\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\n2\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4N2 \\leq Q \\leq N2\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Di\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq D_i \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Di\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSample Input:\n5\r\n3 \r\n1 2 8 4 9\n\nSample Output:\n3\n\nEXPLANATION:\nVasu can select the questions with difficulty rating 111, 444 and 888 resulting in a minimum rating difference of 333.'
