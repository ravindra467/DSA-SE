b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nThis is not intended to be the tie-break problem.\nIn the Chefland army, there are MMM generals (numbered 111 through MMM) and NNN soldiers (numbered 111 through NNN).\nThe Army has a vertical hierarchy \xe2\x80\x95 a soldier may command many other soldiers (including zero), but each soldier has at most one commander. A soldier yyy is a subordinate of a soldier xxx if soldier xxx is the commander of soldier yyy or there is a soldier zzz commanded by soldier xxx such that soldier yyy is a subordinate of soldier zzz. No soldier is commanded by one of their subordinates because every soldier is feared by all of his subordinates. Moreover, all soldiers are subordinates of soldier 111. Let's denote the commander of soldier iii by pip_ipi\xe2\x80\x8b (p1=0p_1 = 0p1\xe2\x80\x8b=0 since soldier 111 cannot have a commander).\nAs in any organisation, the generals have some soldiers they hate. If a general meets a soldier whom he hates, this general becomes angry for the rest of the day.\nThe soldiers should be paid some wages over one or more days. For each valid iii, soldier iii should be paid SiS_iSi\xe2\x80\x8b chefcoins. Shyam is in charge of this; he should choose an integer DDD (0\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa4N20 \\le D \\le N^20\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa4N2) and during each of the next DDD days, perform the following process:\n\nChoose an integer KKK and KKK soldiers, then call these soldiers to report their feats to the generals. Shyam is very careful \xe2\x80\x95 on each day, he chooses these soldiers in such a way that there are no two called soldiers where one is afraid of the other (in other words, no called soldier is a subordinate of another called soldier).\nChoose a positive real number RRR and give each of the called soldiers RRR chefcoins.\nFor each soldier vvv and general uuu, if soldier vvv was called and is hated by general uuu, then general uuu becomes angry. Let GGG be the total number of angry generals on this day. Then, the total angriness of the generals increases by G\xe2\x8b\x85RG \\cdot RG\xe2\x8b\x85R.\nBefore the start of the next day, the generals that were angry calm down and are not angry anymore (so they can become angry again).\n\nHelp Shyam pay the soldiers while minimising the total angriness of the generals over all DDD days.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers MMM and NNN.\nEach of the next MMM lines contains a binary string BBB with length NNN. For each valid iii and jjj, the jjj-th character in the iii-th of these strings is '1' if general iii hates soldier jjj or '0' otherwise.\nThe next line contains NNN space-separated integers S1,S2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SNS_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_NS1\xe2\x80\x8b,S2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,SN\xe2\x80\x8b.\nThe last line contains NNN space-separated integers p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pNp_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_Np1\xe2\x80\x8b,p2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,pN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case:\n\nFirst, print a line containing a single integer DDD (0\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa4N20 \\le D \\le N^20\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa4N2) \xe2\x80\x95 the number of days during which the soldiers are paid.\nThen, print DDD lines. In each of these lines, print an integer KKK, a space, a real number RRR, a space and KKK space-separated integers x1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xKx_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_Kx1\xe2\x80\x8b,x2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,xK\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x95 the numbers of the called soldiers.\nFor each valid iii, let the total amount of money received by soldier iii be WiW_iWi\xe2\x80\x8b; your answer will be considered correct if \xe2\x88\xa3Wi\xe2\x88\x92Si\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa410\xe2\x88\x926|W_i - S_i| \\le 10^{-6}\xe2\x88\xa3Wi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\x92Si\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa410\xe2\x88\x926.\n\nConstraints\n\nT=50T = 50T=50\nM=16M = 16M=16\nN=128N = 128N=128\n0\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa4N0 \\le p_i \\le N0\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid iii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Si\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le S_i \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4Si\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4100 for each valid iii\n\nTest generation\nFor each test case:\n\nS1,S2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SNS_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_NS1\xe2\x80\x8b,S2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,SN\xe2\x80\x8b are chosen uniformly randomly and independently between 111 and 100100100.\nFor each valid iii, pip_ipi\xe2\x80\x8b is chosen uniformly randomly between 111 and i\xe2\x88\x921i-1i\xe2\x88\x921.\nFor each test case, a real number ppp is chosen manually. There are 101010 test cases for each p\xe2\x88\x88{0.1,0.2,0.5,0.7,0.8}p \\in \\{0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8\\}p\xe2\x88\x88{0.1,0.2,0.5,0.7,0.8}.\nFor each valid iii and jjj, Bi,jB_{i,j}Bi,j\xe2\x80\x8b is chosen to be '1' with probability ppp or '0' with probability 1\xe2\x88\x92p1-p1\xe2\x88\x92p.\n\nScoring\nThe score of each test case is the sum of R\xe2\x8b\x85GR \\cdot GR\xe2\x8b\x85G over all DDD days. The score of a submission is equal to the sum of its scores over all test cases.\nThe goal is to minimise the score of your submission. However, this problem is solvable optimally \xe2\x80\x95 there is a solution which is guaranteed to score 100 points.\nExample Input\n1\r\n3 4\r\n0000\r\n1111\r\n0101\r\n1 2 3 4\r\n0 1 1 3\n\nExample Output\n5\r\n2 1 2 4\r\n2 1 2 3\r\n1 2 3\r\n1 3 4\r\n1 1 1\n"
