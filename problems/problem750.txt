Every disappointment you face in life will be balanced by something good for you! Keep going, never give up."\nLet\'s call a string balanced if all characters that occur in this string occur in it the same number of times.\nYou are given a string SSS; this string may only contain uppercase English letters. You may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero): choose one letter in SSS and replace it by another uppercase English letter. Note that even if the replaced letter occurs in SSS multiple times, only the chosen occurrence of this letter is replaced.\nFind the minimum number of operations required to convert the given string to a balanced string.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single string SSS.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum number of operations.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410,0001 \\le T \\le 10,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa41,000,0001 \\le |S| \\le 1,000,0001\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa41,000,000\nthe sum of \xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3|S|\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3 over all test cases does not exceed 5,000,0005,000,0005,000,000\nSSS contains only uppercase English letters\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points):\n\nT\xe2\x89\xa410T \\le 10T\xe2\x89\xa410\n\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa418|S| \\le 18\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa418\n\nSubtask #2 (80 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\nABCB\nBBC1\n1\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: We can change \'C\' to \'A\'. The resulting string is "ABAB", which is a balanced string, since the number of occurrences of \'A\' is equal to the number of occurrences of \'B\'.\nExample case 2: We can change \'C\' to \'B\' to make the string "BBB", which is a balanced string.'
