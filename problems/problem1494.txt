b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Russian, Bengali, and Mandarin Chinese as well.\nYou are given an undirected graph with NNN nodes (numbered 111 through NNN) and MMM edges. Each edge connects two distinct nodes. However, there may be multiple edges connecting the same pairs of nodes, and they are considered to be distinct edges. A lowercase English letter is written in each node.\nYou are also given a string SSS with length LLL. A beautiful path is a sequence of L\xe2\x88\x921L-1L\xe2\x88\x921 edges such that there is a sequence of LLL nodes with the following properties:\n\nfor each valid iii, the iii-th edge connects the iii-th and (i+1)(i+1)(i+1)-th of these nodes\nfor each valid iii, the iii-th character of SSS is written in the iii-th of these nodes\n\nThere are no other restrictions \xe2\x80\x94 a path may visit nodes or edges any number of times in any order.\nDetermine the number of beautiful paths in the graph. Since the answer can be very large, compute it modulo 109+710^9+7109+7.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NNN, MMM and LLL.\nThe second line contains a single string SSS with length LLL.\nThe third line contains a single string with length NNN. For each valid iii, the iii-th character of the string is the letter written in the iii-th node.\nTwo lines follow. The first line contains MMM integers u1,\xe2\x80\xa6,umu_1,\\ldots,u_mu1\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,um\xe2\x80\x8b. The second lines contains MMM integers, v1,\xe2\x80\xa6,vmv_1,\\ldots,v_mv1\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,vm\xe2\x80\x8b. This denotes that there is an edge connecting nodes uiu_iui\xe2\x80\x8b and to viv_ivi\xe2\x80\x8b. These edges are distinct, even though they may connect the same pair of nodes.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of beautiful paths modulo 109+710^9+7109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42001 \\le T \\le 2001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4200\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41032 \\le N \\le 10^32\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\le M \\le 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4103\n2\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4202 \\le L \\le 202\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa420\nSSS contains only lowercase English letters\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le u, v \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\nu\xe2\x89\xa0vu \\neq vu\xee\x80\xa0=v\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n4 4 3\naac\naaca\n1 2 2 1\n2 3 4 2\n2 1 2\naa\naa\n1\n23\n1\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: The three beautiful paths (sequences of edges) are:\n\n(1,2)(1,2)(1,2), passing through nodes (1,2,3)(1,2,3)(1,2,3) in this order\n(4,2)(4,2)(4,2), also passing through nodes (1,2,3)(1,2,3)(1,2,3)\n(3,2)(3,2)(3,2), passing through nodes (4,2,3)(4,2,3)(4,2,3)\n\nExample case 2: There is only one beautiful path, which contains only edge 111.
