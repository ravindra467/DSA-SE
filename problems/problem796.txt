b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has been researching ant colonies for many years and finally discovered all their secrets.\nAn ant colony consists of NNN distinct lines (numbered 111 through NNN) that pass through a point O\\mathsf{O}O, which is the queen's home. For each valid iii, there are MiM_iMi\xe2\x80\x8b ants on the iii-th line.\nFor each valid iii and jjj, the jjj-th ant on the iii-th line initially has a non-zero coordinate Xi,jX_{i,j}Xi,j\xe2\x80\x8b with the following meaning:\n\nThe distance of this ant from O\\mathsf{O}O is \xe2\x88\xa3Xi,j\xe2\x88\xa3|X_{i,j}|\xe2\x88\xa3Xi,j\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\xa3.\nLet's choose a direction along the iii-th line from O\\mathsf{O}O. The exact way in which this direction is chosen does not matter here, it only needs to be the same for all ants on the same line.\nIf Xi,jX_{i,j}Xi,j\xe2\x80\x8b is positive, this ant is at the distance \xe2\x88\xa3Xi,j\xe2\x88\xa3|X_{i,j}|\xe2\x88\xa3Xi,j\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\xa3 from O\\mathsf{O}O in the chosen direction. Otherwise, it is at this distance from O\\mathsf{O}O in the opposite direction.\n\nIn other words, two ants jjj and kkk on a line iii are at the same side of O\\mathsf{O}O if the signs of Xi,jX_{i,j}Xi,j\xe2\x80\x8b and Xi,kX_{i,k}Xi,k\xe2\x80\x8b are the same or on opposite sides if the signs are different.\nAll ants move with the same constant speed. Initially, all of them are moving towards O\\mathsf{O}O. Whenever two or more ants meet (possibly at O\\mathsf{O}O), all of these ants turn around and start moving in the opposite directions with the same speed. We call this a collision. Even if an ant reaches O\\mathsf{O}O without meeting an ant there, it keeps moving in the same direction. An ant may change direction multiple times.\nHelp Chef find the total number of collisions between ants. Note that even if more than two ants meet, it counts as only one collision.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nNNN lines follow. For each valid iii, the iii-th of these lines contains an integer MiM_iMi\xe2\x80\x8b, followed by a space and MiM_iMi\xe2\x80\x8b space-separated integers Xi,1,Xi,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Xi,MiX_{i,1}, X_{i,2}, \\ldots, X_{i,M_i}Xi,1\xe2\x80\x8b,Xi,2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,Xi,Mi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the number of collisions between ants.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\leq T \\leq 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Mi\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851051 \\leq M_i \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4Mi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105 for each valid iii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3Xi,j\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq |X_{i,j}| \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3Xi,j\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i,ji,ji,j\nXi,j<Xi,j+1X_{i,j} \\lt X_{i,j+1}Xi,j\xe2\x80\x8b<Xi,j+1\xe2\x80\x8b for each valid i,ji,ji,j\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052 \\cdot 10^52\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of M1+M2+\xe2\x80\xa6+MNM_1 + M_2 + \\ldots + M_NM1\xe2\x80\x8b+M2\xe2\x80\x8b+\xe2\x80\xa6+MN\xe2\x80\x8b over all test cases does not exceed 10610^6106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): N=1N = 1N=1\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n2\n2 -2 1\n1 22\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: First, the ants on the first line collide at the coordinate \xe2\x88\x921/2-1/2\xe2\x88\x921/2 and change directions.
