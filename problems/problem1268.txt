b'Problem\nChef has a garden of size N\xc3\x97NN \\times NN\xc3\x97N. The garden is divided into N2N^2N2 squares of size 1\xc3\x9711\\times 11\xc3\x971 each.\nChef has plants in some unit squares of the garden, because of which, that part looks green.\nFormally, for the ithi^{th}ith row (0\xe2\x89\xa4i<N)(0 \\le i \\lt N)(0\xe2\x89\xa4i<N), Chef has plants in all the columns from AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b to BiB_iBi\xe2\x80\x8b  (both inclusive) where 0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4Bi<N0 \\le A_i \\le B_i \\lt N0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4Bi\xe2\x80\x8b<N.\nHelp Chef find the length of the side of the largest square that is green.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains an integer NNN, the size of the garden.\nThe next NNN lines contain two space-separated integers AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b and BiB_iBi\xe2\x80\x8b, representing that plants are present in all the columns from AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b to BiB_iBi\xe2\x80\x8b (both inclusive) of the ithi^{th}ith row.\n\nOutput Format\nOutput a single integer denoting the length of the side of the largest square that is green. In other words, output the length of the side of the square with maximum size, inside which all unit squares have plants.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\le N \\le 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4Bi<N0 \\le A_i \\le B_i \\lt N0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4Bi\xe2\x80\x8b<N\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n1 1\n0 2\n1 2\n2\nSample 2:\nInputOutput8\n2 4\n2 4\n1 4\n0 7\n0 3\n1 2\n1 2\n1 13\n\nExplanation:\nSample Explanation 111: The garden looks like:\n\nThe largest green square has vertices (1,1),(1,2),(2,2),(2,1)(1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1)(1,1),(1,2),(2,2),(2,1). Thus, the length of the side of the largest green square is 222.\nSample Explanation 222: The garden looks like:\n\nOne of the largest green squares has vertices (0,2),(0,4),(2,4),(2,2)(0,2), (0,4), (2, 4), (2, 2)(0,2),(0,4),(2,4),(2,2). Thus, the length of the side of the largest green square is 333.\nThere may be other squares with same size but it can be proven that no square with length more than 333 is green.'
