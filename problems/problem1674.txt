b"Problem\nRead problems statements in Hindi,\nMandarin chinese\n, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef is organising a contest with PPP problems (numbered 111 through PPP). Each problem has SSS subtasks (numbered 111 through SSS).\nThe difficulty of a problem can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet's denote the score of the kkk-th subtask of this problem by SCkSC_kSCk\xe2\x80\x8b and the number of contestants who solved it by NSkNS_kNSk\xe2\x80\x8b.\nConsider the subtasks sorted in the order of increasing score.\nCalculate the number nnn of valid indices kkk such that NSk>NSk+1NS_k \\gt NS_{k + 1}NSk\xe2\x80\x8b>NSk+1\xe2\x80\x8b.\nFor problem iii, the difficulty is a pair of integers (n,i)(n, i)(n,i).\n\nYou should sort the problems in the increasing order of difficulty levels. Since difficulty level is a pair, problem aaa is more difficult than problem bbb if the number nnn is greater for problem aaa than for problem bbb, or if a>ba \\gt ba>b and nnn is the same for problems aaa and bbb.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers PPP and SSS denoting the number of problems and the number of subtasks in each problem.\n2P2P2P lines follow. For each valid iii, the 2i\xe2\x88\x9212i-12i\xe2\x88\x921-th of these lines contains SSS space-separated integers SC1,SC2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SCSSC_1, SC_2, \\dots, SC_SSC1\xe2\x80\x8b,SC2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,SCS\xe2\x80\x8b denoting the scores of the iii-th problem's subtasks, and the 2i2i2i-th of these lines contains SSS space-separated integers NS1,NS2,\xe2\x80\xa6,NSSNS_1, NS_2, \\dots, NS_SNS1\xe2\x80\x8b,NS2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,NSS\xe2\x80\x8b denoting the number of contestants who solved the iii-th problem's subtasks.\n\nOutput\nPrint PPP lines containing one integer each \xe2\x80\x94 the indices of the problems in the increasing order of difficulty.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4P\xe2\x89\xa4100,0001 \\le P \\le 100,0001\xe2\x89\xa4P\xe2\x89\xa4100,000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa4302 \\le S \\le 302\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa430\n1\xe2\x89\xa4SCi\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le SC_i \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4SCi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4100 for each valid iii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4NSi\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le NS_i \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4NSi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa41,000 for each valid iii\nin each problem, the scores of all subtasks are unique\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (25 points): S=2S = 2S=2\nSubtask #2 (75 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3 3\n16 24 60\n498 861 589\n14 24 62\n72 557 819\n16 15 69\n435 779 2322\n1\n3"
