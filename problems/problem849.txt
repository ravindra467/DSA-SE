b"Problem\nRead problems statements in Russian, Vietnamese, Hindi, Mandarin chinese and Bengali as well.\nChef has an inventory, which can be represented as a row of NNN cells (numbered 111 through NNN). Each cell is either empty or contains a box. Chef wants to rearrange the boxes in such a way that they are all on the left side of the inventory (so if there are KKK boxes, they should occupy the leftmost KKK cells). He may perform two types of moves:\n\nchoose a cell iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x9221 \\le i \\le N-21\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x922); if cells iii and i+2i+2i+2 are empty and cell i+1i+1i+1 contains a box, Chef stands in cell i+2i+2i+2 and pushes the box from cell i+1i+1i+1 to cell iii\nchoose a cell iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x9221 \\le i \\le N-21\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x922); if cells i+1i+1i+1 and i+2i+2i+2 are empty and cell iii contains a box, Chef stands in cell i+1i+1i+1 and pulls the box in cell iii to cell i+1i+1i+1\n\nThe moves may be performed in any order, any number of times (possibly zero).\nFind the minimum number of moves required to get all boxes to the left side of the inventory or determine that it is impossible.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nThe second line contains a string with length NNN describing the inventory. For each iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le i \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the iii-th character of this string is '#' if the iii-th cell contains a box or '.' if the iii-th cell is empty.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of moves required, or \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible to move all boxes to the left.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le T \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n3\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41053 \\le N \\le 10^53\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 10610^6106\n\nExample Input\n3\n6## .#..\n7\n.#.#.#.\n5## .##\n\nExample Output\n1\n6\n-1\n"
