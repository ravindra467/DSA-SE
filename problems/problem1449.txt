b'Problem\nWhile doing his research in the Institute of Lovely Graphs, Rashad came up with another problem called Prime Graph.\nPrime Graph is a simple graph (undirected graph which does not contain any self-loops or multiple-edges) with NNN nodes such that the degree of each node is prime. Rashad wants to know what is the maximum number of edges a prime graph with NNN nodes can contain. Can you help Rashad answer this question?\nNote: The degree of a node in a simple graph is the number of edges that are incident on the node and a prime number is a natural number greater than 111 which has exactly two divisors - 111 and the number itself.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains TTT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains NNN - the number of nodes in the graph.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output the maximum number of edges a prime graph of NNN nodes can contain.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq T \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n3\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41053 \\leq N \\leq 10^53\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n3\n4\n53\n6\n7\n\nExplanation:\n\nFor N=3N = 3N=3 and 444 we can construct a complete graph (a graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge).\nFor N=5N = 5N=5 we can construct a prime graph with at most 777 edges. One such graph is:\n\n'
