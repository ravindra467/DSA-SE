b"Problem\n\xc2\xa0\nFluffy the squirrel is having a workout to keep his body fit. He arrives at a country with n cities arranged in a circle. There is a uni-directional road connecting city i and city i + 1 for all 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 n - 1, with length li kilometres and also there is a road connecting city n and city 1, with length ln kilometres. Fluffy starts at city 1. Every day, he can run at most x kilometres. However, staying in the middle of the road is dangerous, so he cannot reach the next city in time, he'll just stay in his current city and wait for the next day. \n\nFluffy would like to travel a total of y kilometres to become fit. He wonders what is the minimum number of days needed for him to do that. Can you help him?\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\nThe first line contains an integer n, the number of cities. The next line contains n space-seperated integers li, as described above. The next line contains two space-seperated integers, x and y, the maximum distance Fluffy can run per day and the total distance Fluffy needs to run.\nOutput\nOutput a single integer, d, the minimum number of days needed for Fluffy to travel the desired distance. If the task is impossible, output -1 instead.\nConstraints\n\n3 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 200000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 li, x \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 y \xe2\x89\xa4 1018\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (17 points) : n \xe2\x89\xa4 5000\nSubtask 2 (12 points) : li is equal for all 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 n\nSubtask 3 (26 points) : The answer is either -1 or at most equal to 250000\nSubtask 4 (45 points) : Original Constraints\n\nExample\nInput 1:\n3\n4 4 8\n12 33\nOutput 1:\n4\n\n\nInput 2:\n3\n4 4 10\n9 9\n\nOutput 2:\n-1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nExample case 1. On the first day, Fluffy travels 4 + 4 = 8 kilometres by going from town 1 to town 3. He can't go any further because he can walk at most 12 kilometres a day. The next day, he travels to town 2, walking another 8 + 4 = 12 kilometres. On the third day, he goes to town 1, travelling another 4 + 8 = 12 kilometres. At this point, he travelled 8 + 12 + 12 = 32 kilometres, still short of the target which is 33 kilometres. The next day, he will walk 8 more kilometres and reach his target.\n\nExample case 2. Fluffy will walk to town 3 on the first day, travelling 8 kilometres. However, he will never reach his target, which is 9 kilometres, because the next road is 10 kilometres long and he can walk at most 9 kilometres a day. So, he can never reach his goal and the answer is -1."
