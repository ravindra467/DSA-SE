b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef loves to play with iron (Fe) and magnets (Ma). He took a row of NNN cells (numbered 111 through NNN) and placed some objects in some of these cells. You are given a string SSS with length NNN describing them; for each valid iii, the iii-th character of SSS is one of the following:\n\n'I' if the iii-th cell contains a piece of iron\n'M' if the iii-th cell contains a magnet\n'_' if the iii-th cell is empty\n':' if the iii-th cell contains a conducting sheet\n'X' if the iii-th cell is blocked\n\nIf there is a magnet in a cell iii and iron in a cell jjj, the attraction power between these cells is Pi,j=K+1\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x88\xa3j\xe2\x88\x92i\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x88\x92Si,jP_{i,j} = K+1 - |j-i| - S_{i,j}Pi,j\xe2\x80\x8b=K+1\xe2\x88\x92\xe2\x88\xa3j\xe2\x88\x92i\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x88\x92Si,j\xe2\x80\x8b, where Si,jS_{i,j}Si,j\xe2\x80\x8b is the number of cells containing sheets between cells iii and jjj. This magnet can only attract this iron if Pi,j>0P_{i, j} \\gt 0Pi,j\xe2\x80\x8b>0 and there are no blocked cells between the cells iii and jjj.\nChef wants to choose some magnets (possibly none) and to each of these magnets, assign a piece of iron which this magnet should attract. Each piece of iron may only be attracted by at most one magnet and only if the attraction power between them is positive and there are no blocked cells between them. Find the maximum number of magnets Chef can choose.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and KKK.\nThe second line contains a single string SSS with length NNN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the maximum number of magnets that can attract iron.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42,0001 \\le T \\le 2,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le N \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41050 \\le K \\le 10^50\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4105\nSSS contains only characters 'I', 'M', '_', ':' and 'X'\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x851065 \\cdot 10^65\xe2\x8b\x85106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): there are no sheets, i.e. SSS does not contain the character ':'\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n4 5\nI::M\n9 10\nMIM_XII:M1\n2\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: The attraction power between the only magnet and the only piece of iron is 5+1\xe2\x88\x923\xe2\x88\x922=15+1-3-2 = 15+1\xe2\x88\x923\xe2\x88\x922=1. Note that it decreases with distance and the number of sheets.\nExample case 2:\r\nThe magnets in cells 111 and 333 can attract the piece of iron in cell 222, since the attraction power is 101010 in both cases. They cannot attract iron in cells 666 or 777 because there is a wall between them.\nThe magnet in cell 999 can attract the pieces of iron in cells 777 and 666; the attraction power is 888 and 777 respectively."
