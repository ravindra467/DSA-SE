b'Problem\nThe war between CCG and ghouls is raising in Tokyo, Kaneki being king of ghouls is working hard to win this war. Touka has given a very important chest to Kaneki which will increase his ghoul army\xe2\x80\x99s power significantly and might win them the war. But to open the chest Kaneki must solve a puzzle that is engraved on the lock of the chest.\nKaneki has NNN rectangles of width WWW and height HHH. Kaneki wants to fit all these rectangles in a square, (Rectangle(Rectangle(Rectangle cannotcannotcannot bebebe rotated)rotated)rotated) also he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want this square to be big so that his all resources will be wasted in the square instead of war. Kaneki doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have time to solve this puzzle as he is too busy fighting CCG operatives so he has asked for your help, you being a brilliant programmer Kaneki is sure you will be able to solve this puzzle and might treat you to world-famous anteiku\xe2\x80\x99s coffee.\nThe first line of input will contain one integer TTT containing the number of test cases in the input,\r\nFor the next T lines, each line contains three integers NNN, HHH, and WWW respectively.\nYou need to find the minimum size of the square that will be able to fill all n rectangles in it.\nNote - Use large Data types to store variables (unsigned long long for c++ and long long for java).\nInput:\nThe input Contains only one line containing three integers N,HN, HN,H, and WWW.\nOutput:\nOutput must contain only one line containing only one line having only one integer - the minimum side of the square.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq T \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,H,W\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq N, H, W \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4N,H,W\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSample Input:\n  1\r\n  10 2 3\n\nSample Output:\n  9\n'
