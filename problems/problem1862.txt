b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a rooted tree with NNN nodes numbered 1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,N1, 2, \\ldots, N1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,N. Node 111 is the root node. Some of the nodes have a token in them. In one move, you can choose a non-root node that has a token, but its parent doesn't, and move the token from this node to its parent. What is the maximum number of moves you can make?\nNote: When a token is moved out of a node, the node becomes empty, and other tokens will be able to move there.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer TTT, the number of test cases. Each test case contains three lines.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer NNN, the number of nodes in the tree.\nThe second line contains a string sss of length NNN. The character sis_isi\xe2\x80\x8b is 111 if node has a token, and 000 otherwise.\nThe third line contains N\xe2\x88\x921N - 1N\xe2\x88\x921 space separated integers, p2,p3,\xe2\x80\xa6pNp_2, p_3, \\ldots p_Np2\xe2\x80\x8b,p3\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6pN\xe2\x80\x8b, where pip_ipi\xe2\x80\x8b is the parent of node iii.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print the maximum number of moves that can be made on a new line.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\le N\\le 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\nFor each valid iii,  1\xe2\x89\xa4pi<i1\\le p_i \\lt i1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x80\x8b<i.\nThe sum of NNN over all test cases doesn't exceed 10610^6106.\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (13 points): T\xe2\x89\xa410,N\xe2\x89\xa417T \\le 10, N \\le 17T\xe2\x89\xa410,N\xe2\x89\xa417.\nSubtask 2 (18 points): The sum of NNN over all test cases doesn't exceed 200020002000.\nSubtask 3 (41 points): The sum of NNN over all test cases doesn't exceed 10510^5105.\nSubtask 4 (28 points): No additional constraints.\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n5\n01010\n1 1 3 3\n5\n10101\n1 1 3 32\n0\nExplanation:\nIn the first test case, you can first move a token from node 444 to node 333, and then move a token from node 222 to node 111.\nIn the second test case, there are no possible valid moves."
