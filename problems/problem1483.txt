b'Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nRin is attending a university.\nShe has M semesters to finish her program, and that program has N required courses. Each course must be taken in exactly one of the semesters.\nSome courses have prerequisites: for each i from 1 to K, she must take course A[i] before course B[i].\nThe same course may be taught by different professors in different semesters, and how well she does will depend on which professor teaches her. Additionally, some courses may not be taught every semester.\nWe are given an array X representing this information. For each course i and each semester j, X[i][j] = -1 if course i is not taught in semester j. Otherwise, X[i][j] will be an integer between 0 and 100: the expected score Rin will get if she takes course i in semester j.\nRin may take any number of courses per semester, including none, as long as they are taught that semester and she has already taken any required prerequisite courses.\nHelp Rin to find the maximal average score she can get over her whole program.\nInput\nThe first line contain 3 integers: N, M and K.\nThis is followed by N lines, each containing M integers. The jth integer on the ith line represents the value of X[i][j].\nThis is followed by K lines, each containing two integers: A[i] and B[i].\nOutput\nOutput one real number: the maximal average score, rounded to 2 digits after the decimal point.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M, N \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n-1 \xe2\x89\xa4 X[i][j] \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 A[i], B[i] \xe2\x89\xa4 N\nFor each i, A[i] \xe2\x89\xa0 B[i].\nFor different i and j, (A[i], B[i]) \xe2\x89\xa0 (A[j], B[j]).\nWe guarantee there exists a way to take these N courses in M semesters.\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1: (20 Points) A course can have at most 1 pre request course.\n\n\nSubtask 2: (80 Points) Refer to constraints above\n\nExample\nInput 1:\n3 2 2\n70 100\n100 80\n100 90\n1 2\n1 3\n\nOutput 1:\n80.00\n\nInput 2:\n4 5 4\n20 -1 100 -1 -1\n100 30 -1 -1 -1\n100 -1 30 20 40\n100 30 40 50 20\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n3 4\n\nOutput 2:\n32.50\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1\nThe only way she can finish these 3 courses is: take course 1 in the first semester, then take courses 2 and 3 in the second semester. The average score is (70 + 80 + 90) / 3 = 80.00.\nExample case 2\nThe optimal solution is: take course 1 in semester 1, course 2 in semester 2, course 3 in semester 3 and course 4 in semester 4.'
