b'Problem\nYou play the following game against a devilishly clever opponent. On the table, there are two bowls \xef\xac\x81lled with glass beads. In each move, depending on whose turn it is, you or your opponent can do one of the following.\n\nMove one bead from the \xef\xac\x81rst bowl to the second bowl.\nRemove one bead from the second bowl.\n\nAt any point in the game, let xxx denote the number of beads in the \xef\xac\x81rst bowl and yyy denote the number of beads in the second bowl. If x+yx + yx+y is even, it is your turn to move. If x+yx + yx+y is odd, it is your opponent\xe2\x80\x99s turn to move\nAt each position of the game, you get some points that depend on the number of beads, xxx and yyy, in the two bowls. This is given by a function f(x,y)=Ax2+By2+Cxyf(x, y) = Ax^2 + By^2 + Cxyf(x,y)=Ax2+By2+Cxy, where A,BA, BA,B and CCC are integers that are \xef\xac\x81xed each time the game is played.\nThe game starts with MMM beads in the \xef\xac\x81rst bowl and NNN beads in the second bowl. As the game progresses, beads are removed. The game ends when both bowls are empty.\nYour score for the game is the sum of the values f(x,y)f(x, y)f(x,y) for each position (x,y)(x, y)(x,y) that the game passes through, starting from (M,N)(M, N)(M,N) and ending with (0,0)(0, 0)(0,0). Your aim is to obtain as high a score as possible, no matter what moves your opponent chooses. Remember that your opponent is \xef\xac\x81endishly ingenious and will always play in such a way as to minimize your score.\nFor example , suppose the game starts with 222 beads in each bowl and the score function\xc2\xa0is f(x,y)=x2\xe2\x88\x92y2\xe2\x88\x92xyf(x, y) = x^2 \xe2\x88\x92 y^2 \xe2\x88\x92 xyf(x,y)=x2\xe2\x88\x92y2\xe2\x88\x92xy : that is, A=1,B=\xe2\x88\x921A = 1, B = \xe2\x88\x921A=1,B=\xe2\x88\x921 and C=\xe2\x88\x921C = \xe2\x88\x921C=\xe2\x88\x921. Here are some plays of\xc2\xa0the game\xe2\x80\x94the positions where you choose the move are enclosed in boxes and the positions\xc2\xa0where your opponent moves are not enclosed in boxes.\n\nIn this particular game, the best possible score that you can achieve if you consider all\xc2\xa0possible moves that your opponent can choose is \xe2\x88\x9222\xe2\x88\x9222\xe2\x88\x9222. Recall that your devilishly clever\xc2\xa0opponent always plays in such a way that your score is minimized.\nInput Format\nThe input consists of a single line containing \xef\xac\x81ve integers, M,N,A,BM, N, A, BM,N,A,B and CCC where MMM and NNN are the number of beads initially in the \xef\xac\x81rst and second bowl, respectively and A,BA, BA,B and CCC are the coefficients of the score function f(x,y)=Ax2+By2+Cxyf(x, y) = Ax^2 + By^2 + Cxyf(x,y)=Ax2+By2+Cxy\nOutput Format\nThe output should be a single integer, the maximum score that you can achieve in this game.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M,\xe2\x89\xa46001 \\leq N , M , \\leq 6001\xe2\x89\xa4N,M,\xe2\x89\xa4600\n\xe2\x88\x921000\xe2\x89\xa4A,B,C\xe2\x89\xa41000-1000 \\leq A, B, C \\leq 1000\xe2\x88\x921000\xe2\x89\xa4A,B,C\xe2\x89\xa41000\n\n\nSubtasks\n\n\nSubtask 1 (100 points): Original constraints\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2 2 1 -1 -1-22\nExplanation:\nExplained in Statement'
