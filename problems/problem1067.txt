b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nIn Chefland, each person has their own non-empty personal string. When two people with personal strings T1T_1T1\xe2\x80\x8b and T2T_2T2\xe2\x80\x8b (possibly identical) become friends in Chefland, their strings are replaced by a new string S=T1+T1+T2+T2S = T_1 + T_1 + T_2 + T_2S=T1\xe2\x80\x8b+T1\xe2\x80\x8b+T2\xe2\x80\x8b+T2\xe2\x80\x8b, where +++ denotes string concatenation.\nChef recently became friends with Chefina. However, Chefina\'s personal string was her favourite and she got upset when it was replaced by SSS. She wanted her personal string back. Chef does not remember T1T_1T1\xe2\x80\x8b and T2T_2T2\xe2\x80\x8b now, he only knows SSS.\nFind the number of ways in which Chef can retrieve valid strings T1T_1T1\xe2\x80\x8b and T2T_2T2\xe2\x80\x8b from the given string SSS. It is also possible that Chef does not remember SSS correctly, in which case there is no way to retrieve T1T_1T1\xe2\x80\x8b and T2T_2T2\xe2\x80\x8b.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single string SSS.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the number of ways to retrieve T1T_1T1\xe2\x80\x8b and T2T_2T2\xe2\x80\x8b from SSS.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\le T \\le 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4104\n4\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa41054 \\le |S| \\le 10^54\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3|S|\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3 is divisible by 222\nSSS contains only lowercase English letters\nthe sum of \xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3|S|\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3 over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851062 \\cdot 10^62\xe2\x8b\x85106\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\nabcd\naaaa\nababcdccdc0\n1\n1\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: There is no way to choose T1T_1T1\xe2\x80\x8b and T2T_2T2\xe2\x80\x8b.\nExample case 2: Both T1T_1T1\xe2\x80\x8b and T2T_2T2\xe2\x80\x8b must be "a".'
