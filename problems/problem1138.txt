b'Problem\nChef has a string S. Initially, this string is empty. Also, Chef has a sequence of operations. Each operation is of one of the following two types:\n\nadd character to the end of the string S, so the length of S increases by 1.\ndelete the first character of S, so the length of S decreases by 1.\n\n\nAfter each operation Chef asks you the number of distinct substrings of the current string S. Please answer his questions!\n\nInput\nThe first line of input contains Q - the number of operations. Then Q lines follow, each of these lines describes the operation.\n\nAdd operation is of the form "+ C", where C is a lowercase English letter.\nDelete operation is of the from "-".\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that after each operation, the length of S is a positive integer.\n\nOutput\nJust to make the size of your output smaller, Chef asks you the sum of answers of all Q operations modulo 1000000007. \nSo, print a single integer - the sum of answers for all operations (the sum of Q numbers) modulo 1000000007.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xe2\x89\xa4 1000000\n\nExample\nInput:\n8\n+ a\n+ b\n+ a\n+ a\n-\n-\n-\n+ a\nOutput:\n27\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\n\nIn the first test case the string S transforms as follows: \n\nAfter the first operation S = a. The number of distinct substrings is 1: a.\nAfter the second operation S = ab. The number of distinct substrings is 3: a, b, ab.\nAfter the third operation S = aba. Answer is 5: a, b, ab, ba, aba.\nAfter the fourth operation S = abaa. Answer is 8: a, b, ab, ba, aa, aba, baa, abaa.\nAfter the fifth operation S = baa. Answer is 5: a, b, ba, aa, baa.\nAfter the sixth operation S = aa. Answer is 2: a, aa.\nAfter the seventh operation S = a. Answer is 1: a.\nAfter the eighth operation S = aa. Answer is 2: a, aa.\n\n\nThe sum is 1 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 27, 27 modulo 1000000007 = 27, so, you should print 27.\n'
