b'Problem\nRead problems statements Mandarin , Bengali , Hindi , Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nThere is an infinite sheet of paper and a pen. At any time, the pen may be placed above a point (x,y)(x, y)(x,y) on the paper or touching it at a point (x,y)(x, y)(x,y); in both cases, we call the point (x,y)(x, y)(x,y) the position of the pen. The initial position of the pen is (0,0)(0, 0)(0,0).\nYou may perform the following types of actions:\n\nmove the pen down until it touches the paper\nlift the pen (if it was touching the paper); after this action, the pen is not touching the paper\nmove the pen from its current position (x,y)(x, y)(x,y) to (x\xe2\x88\x921,y)(x-1, y)(x\xe2\x88\x921,y) or (x+1,y)(x+1, y)(x+1,y)\nmove the pen from its current position (0,y)(0, y)(0,y) to (0,y+1)(0, y+1)(0,y+1)\n\nActions of the first two types take no time, an action of the third type takes 111 second and an action of the fourth type takes 111 second. Each action may be performed any number of times. You may only move the pen for at most PPP seconds in total.\nWhenever the pen is moved from (x1,y1)(x_1, y_1)(x1\xe2\x80\x8b,y1\xe2\x80\x8b) to (x2,y2)(x_2, y_2)(x2\xe2\x80\x8b,y2\xe2\x80\x8b) while touching the paper, it draws a line segment between these points (inclusive). Drawing over a line segment repeatedly is allowed.\nYou are given NNN special line segments; each of them is parallel with the xxx-axis. A special line segment is fully drawn if each point belonging to it also belongs to some drawn line segment. Your goal is to fully draw as many special line segments as possible in PPP seconds. How many can you fully draw?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and PPP.\nEach of the next NNN lines contains three space-separated integers yyy, sss and eee denoting a special line segment between points (s,y)(s, y)(s,y) and (e,y)(e, y)(e,y) (including these points).\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum number of special segments you can fully draw.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4151 \\le T \\le 151\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa415\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le N \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4s\xe2\x89\xa4e\xe2\x89\xa41060 \\le s \\le e \\le 10^60\xe2\x89\xa4s\xe2\x89\xa4e\xe2\x89\xa4106\n0\xe2\x89\xa4P\xe2\x89\xa41060 \\le P \\le 10^60\xe2\x89\xa4P\xe2\x89\xa4106\n0\xe2\x89\xa4y\xe2\x89\xa42,0000 \\le y \\le 2,0000\xe2\x89\xa4y\xe2\x89\xa42,000\nthe special line segments do not touch or intersect\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\le N \\le 101\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410\nSubtask #2 (90 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4\n1 2\n0 1 2\n3 13\n1 1 2\n3 1 3\n1 3 4\n3 14\n1 1 2\n3 1 3\n1 3 4\n4 10\n1 3 4\n1 1 2\n2 1 2\n2 3 41\n2\n3\n3'
