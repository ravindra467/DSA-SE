b'Problem\nThere are protests going on in the state all around !!!!!! :(  .\nTo reduce the violent nature of Protests,\nThe government has decided to Barricade  Bi-directional roads ,By placing a Barricade  on a Bi-directional  road it will turn to uni-directional road,\nyou being the only Advisor of your state , you realized that there would be transport issues for primary protocols in the town  which are economically very costly , so you decided that  even after placing Barricades , it should be possible to reach each city from every other city , your task is to find the maximum number of bi-directional roads that can be considered for Barricading.\nNOTE : To begin with there is some way from each city to every other city and there can be multiple Bi-directional roads between two cities\nSample Map of the state:\n\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain Two space separated integers N,MN,MN,M, number of cities and Bi-directional Roads\nNext M lines follow two space separated  Integers a and b , which is a road between city a and city b\n\nOutput:\nOutput a single Integer the maximum number of roads which can be considered for Barricading .\nConstraints\n\n\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x971052 \\leq N,M \\leq 2*10^52\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x97105\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x971051 \\leq a,b \\leq 2*10^51\xe2\x89\xa4a,b\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x97105\n\n\nit is guaranteed that a is not equal to b\n\n\nSample Input:\n3 3\n\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1\nSample Output:\n3\n### EXPLANATION:\n\n\n1< ------ > 2 <------ > 3 <----> 1\nIn this case the you can convert it to 1 ----- > 3 ----- >2 ----- > 1, and there is way   from each city to every other city\nanother possibility is 1< -----3 < ------2< ----- 1, so each road can be considered for Barricading'
