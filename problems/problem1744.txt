b"Problem\n Problem Statement \n\nChef has exams coming up , he has taken up  N  subjects this semester. The subjects are numbered from 1 to N. \nHe needs atleast M average marks to pass this semester.\nHe has limited time to study , at each hour he can choose a subject i to study and that increases the amount of marks he is going to get in that subject by C[i].\nFor each subject it is known that if chef doesn't study that subject at all , he still manages to get A[i] marks in that and no matter how much he studies , he can't get more than B[i] marks in that subject (If chef studies the ith subject for X hours , he gets min(B[i] , A[i] + C[i] * X) marks in that subject). \nHelp chef calculate the minimum amount of time of studies he must do in order to pass have an average of atleast M marks or print -1 if he cannot pass under any given circumstances.\nNote that chef can only study a subject for an integer amount of hours.\n\n\n Constraints \n1 <= N <= 100 \n1 <= A[i] < B[i] <= 100 \n1 <= C[i] <= B[i] - A[i]  , C[i] divides (B[i] - A[i]) \n1 <= M <= 100\nInput Format \nThe first line consists of 2 integers N , M.\nThe lines 2 to N - 1 consists of 3 integers denoting A[i - 1] , B[i - 1] , C[i - 1]. \n Output Format  \nPrint the minimum amount of time chef needs to study in order to pass the exam with M average marks or print -1 if chef cannot pass. \nSample \n\nInput\n2 50\n30 70 10\n20 80 10\nOutput\n5\n\nInput\n2 100\n1 100 1\n2 100 2\n\nOutput\n148"
