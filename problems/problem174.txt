b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nThe Professor is going on a trip with his family this weekend. The country where they live is a federation of NNN states (numbered 111 through NNN) with RRR bidirectional interstate roads connecting them. For each road, we know the amount of fuel the Professor needs to traverse it; travelling within a state consumes no fuel. For each iii, the price of fuel in state iii is fixed at FiF_iFi\xe2\x80\x8b units of money per litre.\nDespite Professor's outstanding talent and his great scientific prowess, he has some bad habits as well: he is too penny-wise, so he carries huge barrels in his car in order to store extra petrol and avoid buying petrol in expensive states. Therefore, he is able to carry any amount of fuel he wants at any moment during the trip, and he is also fine with visiting the same state more than once on the trip if it saves him money. The Professor starts the trip without any fuel.\nHelp the Professor find the minimum possible amount of money he should spend on fuel in order to travel from state PPP to state QQQ.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and RRR.\nEach of the next RRR lines contains three space-separated integers uuu, vvv and www denoting that states uuu and vvv are connected by a road and it takes www litres of fuel to traverse that road.\nThe next line contains NNN space-separated integers F1,F2,\xe2\x80\xa6,FNF_1, F_2, \\ldots, F_NF1\xe2\x80\x8b,F2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,FN\xe2\x80\x8b.\nThe next line contains two space-separated integers PPP and QQQ.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum amount of money the Professor has to spend.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa451 \\le T \\le 51\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa43001 \\le N \\le 3001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4300\n1\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x8b\x85(N\xe2\x88\x921)/21 \\le R \\le N \\cdot (N - 1) / 21\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x8b\x85(N\xe2\x88\x921)/2\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v,P,Q\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le u, v, P, Q \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v,P,Q\xe2\x89\xa4N\neach road connects two different states\nno two roads connect the same pair of states\n1\xe2\x89\xa4w\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\le w \\le 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4w\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Fi\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\le F_i \\le 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Fi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid iii\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (40 points): N\xe2\x89\xa450N \\le 50N\xe2\x89\xa450\nSubtask #2 (60 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n4 3\n1 2 3\n2 3 1\n2 4 7\n3 6 2 2\n1 428\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: The Professor can buy 101010 litres of petrol in state 111, travel to state 222 and then to state 444. This way, he spends 303030 units of money. However, the optimal solution is to buy 444 litres of petrol in state 111, travel to state 222, then to state 333, buy 888 litres of petrol in state 333 and then travel to state 444, since this costs only 282828 units of money."
