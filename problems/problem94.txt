b'Problem\n\n\n\n            "Nine is considered a good number in Chinese culture because it sounds the same as the word "long-lasting". Hence many\n            people want their car registration numbers to sum up to 9 on adding the digits recursively.\n        \n\n\n\nA car registration number can consist of 1,2,3 or 4 digits. Examples of some good car numbers are 63, 018, 9099, etc. whereas 12,129 are not            good.\n        \n\n\nWhy is 9099 good?\n\n\n9+0+9+9 = 27\n\n\n2+7 = 9 \n\n\nSimilarly it is not difficult to see why 63, 018, 6669, 9999\xe2\x80\xa6 are good."\n\n\n        Given a string of digits, print how many subsequences of the string result in good car registration numbers.\n    \n\nNote:\n\n\n        The zeros at the starting of the number are to be accounted for, i.e. 018 and 18 are different numbers.\n    \n\nInput\n\n\n        First line of the input contains T (T <= 200) denoting the number of test cases. T lines follow each containing a non-empty single\n        string S. S contains only digits i.e. from [0-9]. Length of S <= 10000.\n    \n<p>\n    <b>Output</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n    For each case print how many subsequences of the string result in <b>good</b> car registration numbers. As the answer can be quite large print it modulo <b>1000000007</b>.\n</p>\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n10292\n01892\n6'
