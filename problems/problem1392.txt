b"Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  , Russian and Vietnamese\nDevu and Churu like to play mathematical games. Today, Devu got hold of a 1-indexed array A consisting of N integers while Churu has an empty array B. They have decided to play with these arrays and have agreed to make their moves turn by turn. Devu in his turn will choose a contiguous segment from his array, i.e, 2 integers L and R such that 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 L \xe2\x89\xa4 R \xe2\x89\xa4 |A|, where |A| denotes the current size of array A. He then inserts this contiguous subarray into Churu\xe2\x80\x99s array at some position K such that 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 |B|+1 where |B| denotes the current size of array B.\nFor example: If Devu inserts a subarray of size S at position X into Churu\xe2\x80\x99s array, then all the elements that were present at position Z such that X \xe2\x89\xa4 Z \xe2\x89\xa4 |B| will get shifted towards right by S positions. Devu\xe2\x80\x99s array would then get rearranged to accumulate the space that was left vacant by removing the segment L to R of his array.\nIn Churu's turn, he has to report the total number of inversions in array B after each of Devu's move.\nDevu is playing well during each of his moves but Churu is getting slower as the number of elements are increasing in his array B. Therefore, he asks for your help.\nYou are provided with Devu's array A and a sequence of all his moves. You have to report the inversion count in churu's array B after each of Devu's move.\nNote : \nIn any arbitrary array C, a pair of indices x and y such that x < y and C[x] > C[y] is known as an inversion.\nInput\nFirst line of input contains two space separated integers N and Q denoting the size of an array A and number of Devu's moves. Next lines of input contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of Devu's array. Next Q lines contain the Q moves, one move per line. Each move consists of three integers L, R and K such that 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 L \xe2\x89\xa4 R \xe2\x89\xa4 |A| and 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 |B|+1 holds.\nOutput\nAfter each of the Devu's move, report the required answer for Churu.\nConstraints\n\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, Q \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\n\nSubtasks\n\nsubtask 1: 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, Q \xe2\x89\xa4 2000 ( 30 pts ), TL = 1 sec\nsubtask 2: 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, Q \xe2\x89\xa4 105, K = |B|+1 where |B| denotes the current size of array B ( 30 pts ) \nsubtask 3: 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, Q \xe2\x89\xa4 105 ( 40 pts )\n\nExample\nInput\n5 4\n4 3 2 5 1\n1 2 1\n3 3 2\n2 2 3\n1 1 2\n\nInput\n1\n2\n3\n5\nExplanation\n\nAfter Q1, A = {2, 5, 1}, B = {4, 3}. Therefore, inversion count in B is 1.\nAfter Q2, A = {2, 5}, B = {4, 1, 3}. Therefore, inversion count in B is 2.\nAfter Q3, A = {2}, B = {4, 1, 5, 3}. Therefore, inversion count in B is 3.\nAfter Q4, A = {}, B = {4, 2, 1, 5, 3}. Therefore, inversion count in B is 5.\n"
