b'Problem\nThere is an organisation having NNN departments,where ithi^{th}ith department has MiM_iMi\xe2\x80\x8b members.\nVermajiVermajiVermaji wants to become president of this organisation and for this, he needs to get at least half of the votes in his favour from each department i.e \xe2\x8c\x88Mi/2\xe2\x8c\x89\\lceil M_i/2 \\rceil\xe2\x8c\x88Mi\xe2\x80\x8b/2\xe2\x8c\x89 members, where ithi^{th}ith department has MiM_iMi\xe2\x80\x8b members. However, he gets to know that none of the members wants to vote for him. As he wants to become president any how, he decides to bribe the members. He has procured N arrays where ithi^{th}ith array contains money demanded by each member of ithi^{th}ith department.\nVermajiVermajiVermaji has infinite amount of money, but being a smart and rich corrupted person he decides to bribe members in such a way that he can win the election and the maximum absolute difference between demands of any two member from any two departments (person may or may not be from same department ) is minimum.\nYou are his friend and also a good programmer. Help him in getting majority of votes i.e atleast \xe2\x8c\x88Mi/2\xe2\x8c\x89\\lceil M_i/2 \\rceil\xe2\x8c\x88Mi\xe2\x80\x8b/2\xe2\x8c\x89 from each department . Tell him the maximum absolute difference between the demands of any two bribed members of any two departments as well as maximum number of votes he can get. Total number of votes in favour of VermajiVermajiVermaji should always be greater than 111 in order to become leader.\nNoteNoteNote: Absolute difference between two numbers xxx,yyy is |xxx-yyy|\nInput Format:\n\nFirst line contains NNN denoting number of departments in organisation.\nFor next NNN lines, first integer MiM_iMi\xe2\x80\x8b denotes size of ithi^{th}ith department which is followed by MiM_iMi\xe2\x80\x8b space seperated integers denoting money demands of members of ithi^{th}ith department.\n\nOutput Format:\n\nOnly one line containing two space separated integers denoting minimum difference and maximum number of votes for that condition respectively.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\x91i=1NMi\xe2\x89\xa41052 \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^{N} M_i \\leq 10^52\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\x91i=1N\xe2\x80\x8bMi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,j\xe2\x89\xa4109-10^9 \\leq A_{i,j} \\leq10^9\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,j\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109,Where Ai,jA_{i,j}Ai,j\xe2\x80\x8bdenotes jthj^{th}jthelement of ithi^{th}itharray.\n\nSample Input1:\n3 \r\n2 1 2\r\n3 -2 3 4 \r\n1 8\n\nSample Output1:\n6 4\n\nSample Input2:\n1\r\n2 1 2\n\nSample Output2:\n1 2\n\nEXPLANATION:\nFor sample test case 1-  List of demands fulfilled by Verma ji for above case is 2,3,4,8.\nFor sample test case 2- As it is necessary to have greater than 1 vote so Vermaji will buy votes from both the person. Hence max difference = (2-1)=1 and max people voting for him = 2.'
