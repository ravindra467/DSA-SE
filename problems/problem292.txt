b'Problem\nA fair is organized in the village. There are N shops in the village fair. All the shops can be classified as a BadBadBad shop or a GoodGoodGood shop. Each shop has certain number of coins (AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b) assigned to it. If someone visits a Good shop, they will get AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b coins and if someone visits a Bad shop they will have to deposit AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b coins.\nA Good shop will have positive AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b (including 0) and a Bad shop will have negative AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b.\nAlice is playing a game. The rule of the game is simple. Alice has to move across ContiguousContiguousContiguous shops in the market lane, if she visits a Bad shop, she have to deposit the number of coins assigned to that shop and if she visits a Good shop, she gets the coins assigned to that shop, the only Restriction being that she can only visit contiguous shops. Formally, Alice can choose any i and j  such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq i \\leq j \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4N and visits all the shops between i and j (both inclusive).\nInitially Alice has 0 coins. Alice can also opt NotNotNot to visit any shop and ends up having 0 coins only. Alice wants to know the maximum coins she can collect. She alone cannot calculate this and asked for your help!. Are you able to tell the maximum number of coins Alice can collect if she plays optimally ?\nInput:\n\nFirst line of input will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nFirst line of testcase contains a single integer NNN, total number of shops in the village.\nSecond line of testcase contains NNN space separated integers, AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b the number of coins associated with the i_t_h shop.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output a single line integer the maximum number of coins Alice can collect.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq T \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\xe2\x88\x92100\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4100-100 \\leq A_i \\leq 100\xe2\x88\x92100\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4100\n\nSample Input:\n3\n9\n4 -2 -3 4 -1 -2 1 5 -3\n3\n-2 -3 -17\n5\n-1 -5 7 0 1\nSample Output:\n7\n0\n8\nEXPLANATION:\nCase #1 : here optimum continuous shops to visit are 4,-1,-2,1,5 i.e.  i=4 to j=8. Choosing any other continuous shops will give you sum less than 7.\nCase #2 : As all shops are Bad, so Alice will not visit any shop and ends up having 0 coins only.\nCase #3 : Here Alice will visits shops 7,0,1 i.e. from i=3 to j=5.'
