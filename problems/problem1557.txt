b'Problem\nGenthru has observed that all the NNN cities on greed island have good trade relations with each other. He deduces that the reason for this is that there exists a route between any pair of cities on greed island. Being a villain he wants to sever the trade relation between at least one pair of cities, so he decides to destroy exactly 1 road among the existing MMM roads. You have to determine the exact number of roads that Genthru could destroy such that it results in there being no route between at least 1 pair of cities.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nNext line contains the number of cities NNN and the number of roads MMM.\nNext MMM lines contain 2 integers aia_iai\xe2\x80\x8b and bib_ibi\xe2\x80\x8b indicating that there exists a road between aia_iai\xe2\x80\x8b and bib_ibi\xe2\x80\x8b.
