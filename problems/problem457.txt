b"Problem\nWhile our warriors, Vegeta and Goku, were training for Battle of Mirror-verse, Whis taught them to transform their hybrid form, Vegito, into a new kind of Sayian. This opened the gates to many unseen abilities and attacks and one of them was Akumaito-Kousen. They mastered this attack and learned to increase it's power to P{P}P. So now if there's an opponent with power less than or equal to P{P}P, he can be destroyed.\nBattle of Mirror-verse is a battle between N{N}N exactly same universes and our universe. Each universe has M{M}M warriors. Each warrior has a strength between 0\xe2\x88\x929{0-9}0\xe2\x88\x929.\nWhen the battle started, Vegeta and Goku transformed into Vegito. Seeing this warriors from other universes also decied to fuse into a giant monster. For fusion, a warrior from each universe must comes forward and contribute into the fusion. Every time a warrior fuses, his strength gets concatenated to the total strength(K{K}K) of the monster(i.e consider 333 mirror universe with 555 similar warrior with strengths = [1,2,3,4,5][1, 2, 3, 4, 5][1,2,3,4,5]. Now a possible fussion can be 1st1st1st warrior from universe 111, 3rd3rd3rd warrior from universe 222 and 4th4th4th warrior from universe 333. The resultant strength will be 134134134). This fusion process comes with a cost, the final strength after the fusion becomes K{K}K % Z{Z}Z.\nYour taks is to calculate how many different giant monsters can our warriors defeat. Since the number can be very large, print is modulo 1000000007{1000000007}1000000007.\nInput:\n\nFirst line contains NNN, MMM, PPP and ZZZ.\nNext Line contains MMM integers denoting the strength of MMM warriors in  each universe.\n\nOutput:\nOutput number of Monsters Vegeta can kill mod 1e9+71e9 + 71e9+7.\nConstraints:\n111 <= N{N}N \\lt= 100001000010000\n111 <= M{M}M \\lt= 100010001000\n222 <= P{P}P < Z{Z}Z \\lt= 100100100\nSample Input:\n2 5 5 10\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nSample Output:\n25\n\nExplanation:\nAll possible combinations will be: 11,12,13,14,15,21,22,23,24,25,31,32,33,34,35,41,42,43,44,45,51,52,53,54,55{11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 21, 22 ,23, 24, 25, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55}11,12,13,14,15,21,22,23,24,25,31,32,33,34,35,41,42,43,44,45,51,52,53,54,55 and when you take mod of each number with 101010, its always less than equal to 555, so the number of monsters which can be killed is 252525."
