b'Problem\nYou are given an integer array( AAA ) of size NNN and an integer value KKK.\nFind the number of sub-arrays of AAA, such that the difference between maximum value and minimum value in the sub array is less than or equal to KKK.\nSub-array is a contiguous portion of an array and two sub-arrays are different if their starting index or ending index is not same.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain two integers NNN and KKK, size of the array and the difference threshold.\nSecond line contains NNN space separated integers, representing the array elements.\n\nOutput:\nPrint a single integer, the number of sub-arrays satisfying the above mentioned condition.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000001 \\leq N \\leq 1000001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4K,A[i]\xe2\x89\xa41090 \\leq K,A[i] \\leq 10^90\xe2\x89\xa4K,A[i]\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSample Input:\n3 2\n7 6 14\n\nSample Output:\n4\n### EXPLANATION:\n\nThe sub-arrays which satisfy the condition are\n\n[7] difference = 0\n[6] difference = 0\n[14] difference = 0\n[7,6] difference = 1\n'
