b"Problem\nChef has NNN items in his Shop (numbered 111 through NNN); And for Each valid iii (111<=iii\\lt=NNN).       the weight of the i\xe2\x88\x92thi-thi\xe2\x88\x92th item is WiWiWi. Since Chef is very sensitive in nature.\nChef wants to arrange all even weights items one side and odd weights items on another side. Chef can arrange two adjacent items with help of swapping at one operation.\nChef wants a minimum number of operations required to arrange All Even weights item on one side and All Odd weights item to the another side.\nChef can\xe2\x80\x99t solve this problem so he asks you to solve it. Help Chef to solve this problem.\nInput:\n\nFirst-line will contain TTT, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single line integer NNN.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers\nW1W1W1,W2W2W2,\xe2\x80\xa6,WNWNWN\n\nOutput:\nPrint the minimum number of operations required Chef can make it. If Chef can't take any operations, print 0.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq T \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41052 \\leq N \\leq 10^52\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n3\xe2\x89\xa4Wi\xe2\x89\xa41053 \\leq Wi  \\leq 10^53\xe2\x89\xa4Wi\xe2\x89\xa4105\nThe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x851053\xe2\x8b\x8510^53\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSample Input:\n3\n6\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n5\n5 7 3 10 20\n3\n1 8 7\n\nSample Output:\n3\n0\n1\n\nEXPLANATION:\nExample case 1:  You can arrange all even numbers right side.\nNumbers of swaps 666 arrange at position 6th6th6th is 000 operations, 444 arrange at position 5th5th5th is 111 operations, 222 arrange at position 4th4th4th is 222 operations.\nGiven array [1,2,3,4,5,6][1,2,3,4,5,6][1,2,3,4,5,6] to [1,3,5,2,4,6][1,3,5,2,4,6][1,3,5,2,4,6]\nTotal : 0 + 1 + 2 = 3 operations\nExample case 2: Initially All odd number one side and all even number another side, so minimum number of operations : 0."
