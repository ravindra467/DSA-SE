b'Problem\nThe Festive season is coming soon and Lisa is worried that her treehouse is not\r\nready for the guests. The house has n rooms and n-1 bidirectional paths. From\r\nany room in the treehouse, there is a path to every other room. For each path\r\nLisa knows whether the path is clean or not.\nShe has n children in her house numbered from 1 to n. If the i-th child is selected\r\nhe promises to clean all the paths from i-th room to room 1, which is the rooted\r\nroom of Lisa\xe2\x80\x99s treehouse. In return, Lisa promises to reward these children with\r\ngifts.\nSince Lisa has a limited amount of money she wants to select the minimum\r\nnumber of children in such a way that after they are selected all the paths in the\r\ntreehouse is clean.\nInput:\n\nThe first line consists of n the number of rooms in Lisa\xe2\x80\x99s treehouse\nThe next n-1 lines contains three natural numbers u,v and w where u and v are the connected rooms and w represents the condition of the edge {u,v}.\nIf w is 1 then the edge {u,v} is clean otherwise if w contains 2 then {u,v} is untidy .\n\nOutput:\nPrint a single integer the minimum number of children Lisa needs to clean the treehouse\nConstraints\n\n2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41052 \\leq n \\leq 10^52\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n1 \\leq u,v \\leq n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4w\xe2\x89\xa421 \\leq w \\leq 21\xe2\x89\xa4w\xe2\x89\xa42\n\nNOTE:- The treehouse represents a tree.\nSample Input:\n4\n1 2 2\n2 3 1\n2 4 2\nSample Output:\n1'
