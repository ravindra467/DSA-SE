b"Problem\nThere is a tree with NNN nodes numbered from 111 to  NNN outside Harshikaa's house. The tree is rooted at node 111. Initially the tree was dry, there were no raindrops on any node of the tree. Suddenly it started raining, and every second a drop falls on all the leaf nodes of the tree. Also, every second any drop which wasn't already on the root node moves one node closer to the root.\nSometimes, strong winds shake the tree and all drops which were not on the root fall off. It is known that the wind will shake the tree MMM times at A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6AMA_1, A_2, \\ldots A_MA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6AM\xe2\x80\x8b seconds after it started raining.\nIf multiple events happen at the same second, they are in this order:\n\nRaindrops move one node closer to the root.\nNew raindrops fall on the leaves.\nWind shakes the tree.\n\nHow many drops are there at the root right after the MMM-th shake?\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of each input contains TTT - the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and MMM - the number of nodes on the tree and the number of shake events.\nN\xe2\x88\x921N - 1N\xe2\x88\x921 lines follow, each line containing two space-separated integers UUU and VVV denoting an edge between node UUU and VVV on the tree.\nThe next line contains MMM space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AMA_1, A_2, \\dots, A_MA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AM\xe2\x80\x8b - the timestamp of the shakes.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output in a single line the number of raindrops on the root right after the MMM-th shake.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq T \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000002 \\leq N \\leq 1000002\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4U,V\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq U, V \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4U,V\xe2\x89\xa4N\nU\xe2\x89\xa0VU \\neq VU\xee\x80\xa0=V\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41000001 \\leq M \\leq 1000001\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4100000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\nAAA is strictly increasing\nSum of NNN over all test cases is not more than 5\xe2\x8b\x851055 \\cdot 10^55\xe2\x8b\x85105\nSum of MMM over all test cases is not more than 4\xe2\x8b\x851054 \\cdot 10^54\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n5 2\n2 1\n1 3\n4 3\n3 5\n2 5\n5\n\nExplanation:\n\nTest case 111: Let's define an array RRR, where RiR_iRi\xe2\x80\x8b is the number of raindrops on the iii-th node.\n\n\nAt second 000, R=[0,0,0,0,0]R = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]R=[0,0,0,0,0].\n\n\nAt second 111, a raindrop fell on all leaves.

At the end of second 222, R=[1,0,0,0,0]R = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]R=[1,0,0,0,0].\n\n\n\nAt second 333, new raindrops fell, and RRR becomes [1,1,0,1,1][1, 1, 0, 1, 1][1,1,0,1,1].\n\n\nAt second 444, RRR becomes [2,1,2,1,1][2, 1, 2, 1, 1][2,1,2,1,1].\n\n\nAt second 555,\n\nFirstly, raindrops moved closer to the root, so RRR becomes [5,0,2,0,0][5, 0, 2, 0, 0][5,0,2,0,0].\nSecondly, a raindrop fell on all leaves, so RRR becomes [5,1,2,1,1][5, 1, 2, 1, 1][5,1,2,1,1].\nThirdly, the tree was shook, so every raindrop except the one on root fell. At the end of second 555, R=[5,0,0,0,0]R = [5, 0, 0, 0, 0]R=[5,0,0,0,0].\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, at the end there were 555 drops at the root."
