b'Problem\nChef is a soldier of Chefland. Whenever Chef fights in any battle he always wins. The reason behind this is not that Chef is bravo but he always joins the group which is already strong and there are high chances of winning.\nIn Chefland there is NNN number of soldiers live excluding Chef with strengths A1,A2,.......ANA_1, A_2,.......A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,.......AN\xe2\x80\x8b. A huge battle is only possible if the following conditions exist:\n\nIf you can divide all soldiers into two groups(not necessarily equal size) excluding Chef.\nGrouping is done in such a way that one group has maximum strength possible.\nAt least one member of a group must have challenged at least one member of another group for war(If two or more groups exist).\nIf two soldiers challenged themself then they can not exist in the same group because they became enemies to each other.\nIt is possible that two different soldiers challenge the same soldier.\nIf a soldier S1S_1S1\xe2\x80\x8b challenges a soldier S2S_2S2\xe2\x80\x8b then they must join the different groups.\nOne soldier only exists in one group.\n\nExample1\nLet\'s consider the following situation.\n\nAs you can see there are four solders that exist in the Chefland, S1,S2,S3S_1, S_2, S_3S1\xe2\x80\x8b,S2\xe2\x80\x8b,S3\xe2\x80\x8b, and S4S_4S4\xe2\x80\x8b. Edges represent the challenges made by themself. As S1S_1S1\xe2\x80\x8b is an enemy of S2S_2S2\xe2\x80\x8b so they cannot exist in the same group. Likewise (S2(S_2 (S2\xe2\x80\x8b&S3),(S3S_3), (S_3S3\xe2\x80\x8b),(S3\xe2\x80\x8b&S1) S_1)S1\xe2\x80\x8b) and (S2(S_2 (S2\xe2\x80\x8b&S4) S_4)S4\xe2\x80\x8b) can not exist in same group. One possible group can be (S1),(S2),(S3,S4)(S_1), (S_2), (S_3, S_4)(S1\xe2\x80\x8b),(S2\xe2\x80\x8b),(S3\xe2\x80\x8b,S4\xe2\x80\x8b). As S4S_4S4\xe2\x80\x8b is not an enemy of S1S_1S1\xe2\x80\x8b and S3S_3S3\xe2\x80\x8b so he can join either group. As we cannot divide everyone into two groups so the huge battle is not possible.\nExample2\n\nLet\'s say the strengths of A,B,C,DA, B, C, DA,B,C,D are 10,6,7,810,6,7,810,6,7,8. The only groups exist are g1(A,D)g_1(A, D)g1\xe2\x80\x8b(A,D) and g2(B,C)g_2(B, C)g2\xe2\x80\x8b(B,C). The Sum of strengths in the groups is 181818 and 131313, and we can devide soldiers into two groups so the huge is possible and Chef will join the first group because of it\'s higher strength.\nIf all soldiers made MMM challenge to each other then you need to find out the maximum possible strength of the team which Chef will join.\nInput:\n\nThe first line of each test case contains TTT, the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test cases contains two integers NNN and MMM, the number of soldiers and challenges.\nThe second line of each test case will contain a stream of integers AAA, strengths of the soldiers.\nThen MMM lines follow after the second line, contains two integers uuu and vvv denotes they are enemy to each other i.e, they challenged each other. You can clearly see that it is not possible to divide them into two groups so the huge battle is not possible here.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, if an answer exists then print "YES" without quotes and also print maximum strengths in the second-line otherwise only print "NOT POSSIBLE" in one line if a huge war is not possible.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq T \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000001 \\leq N \\leq 1000001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4min(100000,N\xe2\x88\x97(N\xe2\x88\x921)/2)0 \\leq M \\leq min(100000, N*(N-1)/2)0\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4min(100000,N\xe2\x88\x97(N\xe2\x88\x921)/2)\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq u,v \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41080 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^80\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4108\n\nSample Input1:\n2\n2 1\n5 6\n1 2\n3 3\n1 2 3\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1\nSample Output:\nYES\n6\nNOT POSSIBLE\nEXPLANATION:\nTest Case1: From the test case, it is seen that there exist only two teams one with strength 5 and another with strength 6, so Chef will join team with maximum strength i.e, 6.\nTest Case2: You can not divide into two teams, so the huge war is not possible.'
