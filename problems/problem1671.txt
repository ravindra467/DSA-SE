b'Problem\nProblem description.\nChaitya is a great problem solver. He found that most of his problems could be solved by arranging them in a particular order. The problem input consists of N. numbers, smaller than or equal to M. Chaitya\xe2\x80\x99s analysis consists of sorting this sequence according to their occurrences.\nThe output must be sorted so that for two numbers A and B, A will appear before B if the number of times A appears in the original order is larger than the number of times B does. If the number of occurrences is equal, the number whose value appears sooner in the input should appear sooner in the sorted sequence.\nHelp Chaitya by creating a custom sorting tool.\nInput\nFirst line of input contains two integers, N, length of message, and M, the number from task description. Next line contains N integers smaller than or equal to M..\nOutput\nOutput should contain N numbers in the required sequence.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N  \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 10^5 \nExample 1 :\nInput\n7 3\n2 3 3 3 2 1 2\nOutput\n2 2 2 3 3 3 1\nExample 2 :\nInput\n4 2\n2 1 2 2 \nOutput\n2 2 2 1'
