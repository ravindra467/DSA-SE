b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has two matrices AAA and BBB, each with size N\xc3\x97MN \\times MN\xc3\x97M. Each cell of the matrix AAA contains a character '0' or '1', while each cell of the matrix BBB contains '?', '0' or '1'.\nThe matrix AAA can be modified using zero or more operations. In one operation, Chef can choose two cells in the matrix AAA which lie either in the same row or in the same column and flip the characters in each of these cells (flipping means changing '1' to '0' or '0' to '1').\nChef wants the matrix AAA to match the matrix BBB. Formally, for each row rrr and column ccc, if the cell in row rrr and column ccc of BBB contains '0' or '1', then he wants the cell in row rrr and column ccc of AAA to contain the same character; otherwise (for cells containing '?'), it may contain either '0' or '1'.\nThe difficulty of your task is described by a parameter EEE. If E=0E = 0E=0, you should only find the smallest number of operations required to achieve this goal. If E=1E = 1E=1, you should also find one sequence of operations with the smallest length which achieves it.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NNN, MMM and EEE.\nNNN lines follow. For each valid iii, the iii-th of these lines contains a single string AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b with length MMM describing the iii-th row of the matrix AAA.\nNNN more lines follow. For each valid iii, the iii-th of these lines contains a single string BiB_iBi\xe2\x80\x8b with length MMM describing the iii-th row of the matrix BBB.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case:\n\nIf it is not possible to make AAA match BBB, print a single line containing the integer \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921.\nOtherwise, first, print a line containing a single integer KKK \xe2\x80\x95 the smallest required number of operations.\nThen, if E=1E = 1E=1, print KKK lines describing the sequence of operations you want to perform. An operation should be printed in one of the following formats:\n\nR r i j to flip the characters in cells in row rrr and columns iii and jjj (1\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le r \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4N, 1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4M1 \\le i, j \\le M1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4M)\nC c i j to flip the characters in cells in column ccc and rows iii and jjj (1\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa4M1 \\le c \\le M1\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa4M, 1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le i, j \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4N)\n\n\n\nIf there are several possible answers, you may find any one of them.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le T \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n0\xe2\x89\xa4E\xe2\x89\xa410 \\le E \\le 10\xe2\x89\xa4E\xe2\x89\xa41\nfor each valid iii, AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b contains only characters '0' and '1'\nfor each valid iii, BiB_iBi\xe2\x80\x8b contains only characters '?', '0' and '1'\nthe sum of N\xe2\x8b\x85MN \\cdot MN\xe2\x8b\x85M over all test cases does not exceed 200,000200,000200,000\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points):\n\nT\xe2\x89\xa43T \\le 3T\xe2\x89\xa43\nN\xe2\x8b\x85M\xe2\x89\xa416N \\cdot M \\le 16N\xe2\x8b\x85M\xe2\x89\xa416\n\nSubtask #2 (10 points):\n\ninitially, for each pair of side-adjacent cells in the matrix AAA, the characters in them are different (AAA follows a chessboard pattern)\nfor each valid iii, each character of BiB_iBi\xe2\x80\x8b is '0'\n\nSubtask #3 (30 points):\n\nE=0E = 0E=0\nfor each valid iii, BiB_iBi\xe2\x80\x8b contains only characters '0' and '1'\n\nSubtask #4 (50 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n3 3 1\n010\n101\n101\n100\n110\n?00\n2 2 0\n10\n01\n0?\n??\n1 3 1\n101\n0103\nC 2 1 2\nC 3 2 3\nC 1 3 1\n1\n-1\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: This is not the only solution ? a valid sequence of 333 row operations also exists.\nExample case 2: We did not restore the sequence of operations because E=0E = 0E=0."
