Aniket does 2 kinds of operations on Harsh\'s collection.\n\nUpdate: He changes the value of xth number to  y .\nQuery: He asks if there exist any suffix in his ordered collection such that its sum is exactly  z .\n\n\nCan you help Harsh to do these operations and answer the queries.\n\n\nInput\nFirst line contains an integer n denoting the size of Harsh\'s collection. \nNext line contains n integers denoting a1, a2 ... an the numbers in Harsh\'s collection. Next line contains an integer q denoting the number of operations Aniket does.  Next q lines follow in following format: \n\n1 x y:  Change the value of xth number to y.\n2 z: Find out if there exist any suffix with sum exactly equal to z. \n\nOutput\nFor every query operation(i.e. of kind 2), print the answer of the query. Print "YES" (without quotes) if there exists a suffix having sum equal to z, otherwise print "NO".\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 ai ,y\xe2\x89\xa4 109\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 q \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 x \xe2\x89\xa4 n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4 z \xe2\x89\xa4 1014\n\nExample\nInput 1:\n5\n10 1 9 8 11\n6\n2 19\n1 3 13\n2 28\n2 32\n1 1 100\n2 133\n\nOutput 1:\nYES\nNO\nYES\nYES\n\n\n\n'
