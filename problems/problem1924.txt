b'Problem\n\xc2\xa0\n\nYou are given a rooted tree with n vertices numbered from 0 to n-1 such that it\xe2\x80\x99s root is vertex numbered 0. Also, each vertex is assigned an integer x (such that value[i]=x).\nNow you are given q queries such that each query consists of a vertex number. For each query you need to answer the following (let the vertex given in a query be v):\nLet us consider the path from root of the tree to vertex v. Now you need to find a vertex in this path which has a value greater than or equal to \xe2\x80\x9cvalue[v]-value[0]\xe2\x80\x9d. If there are many such vertices then you need to find the vertex closest to the given vertex (i.e. v) and if there is no such vertex then return \xe2\x80\x9c-1\xe2\x80\x9d.\n*NOTE: It\xe2\x80\x99s is given that the root is assigned the least value of the tree such that \xe2\x80\x9cvalue[v]-value[0]\xe2\x80\x9d is always positive. \nAlso it is given that the queries does not  contain the root vertex.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\nFirst line contains two integer n and q. Next line contains n spaced integers specifying the value assigned to each vertex. This follows with the next n-1 lines which describes the edges of the tree. Finally q lines follow which represents the queries where each line consists of an integer representing the vertex for which the query is to be answered.\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\nIt consists of q lines where each line contains two integers one representing the vertex number and the other representing the value corresponding to that vertex.Also if no such vertex exists output \xe2\x80\x9c-1\xe2\x80\x9d for that query.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 x \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 q \xe2\x89\xa4 1000000\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n6 2\n1 12 8 5 7 4\n0 1\n0 2\n1 3\n3 4\n3 5\n2\n5\nOutput:\n-1\n3 5\n\xc2\xa0'
