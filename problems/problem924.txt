b"Problem\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese\n, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nAfter six days, professor GukiZ decided to give more candies to his students. Like last time, he has NNN students, numbered 111 through NNN. Let's denote the number of candies GukiZ gave to the iii-th student by pip_ipi\xe2\x80\x8b. As GukiZ has a lot of students, he does not remember all the exact numbers of candies he gave to the students. He only remembers the following properties of the sequence ppp:\n\nThe numbers of candies given to each of the first KKK students (p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pKp_1, p_2, \\dots, p_Kp1\xe2\x80\x8b,p2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,pK\xe2\x80\x8b) are known exactly.\nAll elements of the sequence ppp are distinct and positive.\nGukiZ didn't give more than xxx candies to any student (the maximum value in the sequence ppp is not greater than xxx).\nFor each student iii, there is at least one other student jjj such that \xe2\x88\xa3pi\xe2\x88\x92pj\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4D|p_i - p_j| \\le D\xe2\x88\xa3pi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\x92pj\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4D.\nThe professor gave out the biggest possible total number of candies, i.e. S=p1+p2+p3+\xe2\x80\xa6+pNS = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + \\ldots + p_NS=p1\xe2\x80\x8b+p2\xe2\x80\x8b+p3\xe2\x80\x8b+\xe2\x80\xa6+pN\xe2\x80\x8b is maximum possible.\n\nGukiZ would like to know the total number of candies SSS he had at the beginning. However, times change and after six days, the professor is really tired, so it is possible that there is no sequence ppp which satisfies the constraints. Can you help GukiZ find the number of candies he gave out, or tell him that he must have made a mistake?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers NNN, KKK, xxx, DDD.\nThe second line contains KKK distinct space-separated integers p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pKp_1, p_2, \\dots, p_Kp1\xe2\x80\x8b,p2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,pK\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of candies GukiZ had, or \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 if there is no valid sequence ppp.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4501 \\le T \\le 501\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa450\n3\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41093 \\le N \\le 10^93\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4min(N,2\xe2\x8b\x85104)1 \\le K \\le \\mathrm{min}(N, 2 \\cdot 10^4)1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4min(N,2\xe2\x8b\x85104)\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851091 \\le x \\le 2 \\cdot 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\le D \\le 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa4x1 \\le p_i \\le x1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4x for each valid iii\nAll values pip_ipi\xe2\x80\x8b from input are distinct### Subtasks\nSubtask #1 (15 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4x,N,D\xe2\x89\xa4151 \\leq x, N, D \\leq 151\xe2\x89\xa4x,N,D\xe2\x89\xa415\n\nSubtask #2 (35 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4x,N,D\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq x, N, D \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4x,N,D\xe2\x89\xa4105\nSubtask #3 (50 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n4 3 5 3\n2 1 5\n3 2 8 2\n3 812\n-1\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: There are four students. We know that the first student got p1=2p_1 = 2p1\xe2\x80\x8b=2 candies, the second student got p2=1p_2 = 1p2\xe2\x80\x8b=1 and the third got p3=5p_3 = 5p3\xe2\x80\x8b=5 candies; we don't know the number of candies given to the last student. The maximum possible amount of candies given to some student is x=5x=5x=5. The best possible option is giving p4=4p_4=4p4\xe2\x80\x8b=4 candies to the last student. Then, the fourth constraint (with D=3D=3D=3) is satisfied for all students. Only the pair of students (2,3)(2, 3)(2,3) have numbers of candies that differ by more than 333, but still, for each student, there are at least two other students with close enough numbers of candies.\nExample case 2: GukiZ made some mistake in distribution and there is no valid sequence ppp. The answer is \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921."
