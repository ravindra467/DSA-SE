b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nThere are NNN students standing in a row and numbered 111 through NNN from left to right. You are given a string SSS with length NNN, where for each valid iii, the iii-th character of SSS is 'x' if the iii-th student is a girl or 'y' if this student is a boy. Students standing next to each other in the row are friends.\nThe students are asked to form pairs for a dance competition. Each pair must consist of a boy and a girl. Two students can only form a pair if they are friends. Each student can only be part of at most one pair. What is the maximum number of pairs that can be formed?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single string SSS.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the maximum number of pairs.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le T \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le N \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3=N|S| = N\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3=N\nSSS contains only characters 'x' and 'y'\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x851053 \\cdot 10^53\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\nxy\nxyxxy\nyy1\n2\n0\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: There is only one possible pair: (first student, second student).\nExample case 2: One of the ways to form two pairs is: (first student, second student) and (fourth student, fifth student).\nAnother way to form two pairs is: (second student, third student) and (fourth student, fifth student)."
