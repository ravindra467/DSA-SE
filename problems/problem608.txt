b"Problem\n \xc2\xa0 You are given a rooted tree having nodes N . Every node have value equal to zero initially ,\n\n Let's call it version 1. You will be given Q queries of two type:-\n\n111 ver1ver1ver1 ver2ver2ver2 vvv ccc \nYou have to make version ver2ver2ver2 from version ver1ver1ver1 by adding value ccc in subtree\nof vertex vvv at alternate levels , starting from level of vertex vvv.\n222 ver1ver1ver1 vvv\n\nYou have to tell value of vertex vvv in version ver1ver1ver1\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that in query , version ver1ver1ver1 already exist and version ver2ver2ver2 \ndoes not exist .\n\nInput Format\n\nFirst line contains Number of nodes N.\nSecond line contains N-1 integers denoting the parent of nodes from 2 to N.\nThird line contains number of queries Q\nNext Q line contains queries of two types as explained in the question.\n\nOutput Format\n\nFor each query of type 2 answer the value of node vvv in version ver1ver1ver1 in a single line.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 NNN \xe2\x89\xa4 200000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 QQQ \xe2\x89\xa4 200000\n1  \xe2\x89\xa4 ver1ver1ver1 \xe2\x89\xa4Q\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 ver2ver2ver2 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q+1\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 ccc \xe2\x89\xa4 300000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 vvv \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n\n\nSubtasks\n\n\n100 points : Orignal Constraints\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput5\n1 1 2 4\n6\n1 1 2 4 1\n1 2 3 1 2\n2 1 5\n2 3 4\n1 2 4 2 4\n2 4 5\n0\n3\n4\n\nExplanation:\n                 1\n                / \\\n               2   3\n              /\n             4\n            /\n           5\n\nvalue in version 1 - > [0,0,0,0,0]\nvalue in version 2 - > [0,0,0,1,0]\nvalue in version 3 - > [2,0,0,3,0]\nvalue in version 4 - > [0,4,0,1,4]"
