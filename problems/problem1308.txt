b"Problem\nThere is a hallway of length N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 and you have MMM workers to clean the floor. Each worker is responsible for segment [Li,Ri][L_i, R_i][Li\xe2\x80\x8b,Ri\xe2\x80\x8b], i.e., the segment starting at LiL_iLi\xe2\x80\x8b and ending at RiR_iRi\xe2\x80\x8b. The segments might overlap.\nEvery unit of length of the floor should be cleaned by at least one worker. A worker can clean 111 unit of length of the floor in 111 unit of time and can start from any position within their segment. A worker can also choose to move in any direction. However, the flow of each worker should be continuous, i.e, they can\xe2\x80\x99t skip any portion and jump to the next one, though they can change their direction. What\xe2\x80\x99s the minimum amount of time required to clean the floor, if the workers work simultaneously?\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nEach testcase contains of M+1M + 1M+1 lines of input.\nFirst line contains 222 space separated integers NNN, MMM, length of the hallway and number of workers.\nEach of the next MMM lines contain 222 space separated integers LiL_iLi\xe2\x80\x8b, RiR_iRi\xe2\x80\x8b, endpoints of the segment under ithi^{th}ith worker.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line minimum time required to clean the hallway or \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 if it's not possible to clean the entire floor.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq T \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41092 \\leq N \\leq 10^92\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le M \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Li<Ri\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq L_i \\lt R_i \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4Li\xe2\x80\x8b<Ri\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4N\nThe sum of MMM over all tests is atmost 2\xe2\x88\x971052*10^52\xe2\x88\x97105\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n10 3\n1 10\n1 5\n6 10\n10 1\n2 10\n10 2\n5 10\n1 53\n-1\n5\nExplanation:\nCase 111: The first worker cleans the segment [4,7][4, 7][4,7], the second cleans [1,4][1, 4][1,4] and the third cleans [7,10][7, 10][7,10] each taking 333 units of time. So the minimum time required is 333 units.\nCase 222: Segment [1,2][1, 2][1,2] is not covered by any worker and hence the entire hallway can't be cleaned.\nCase 333: The first worker cleans the segment [5,10][5, 10][5,10] taking 555 units of time, and the second cleans [1,5][1, 5][1,5] taking 444 units of time. So the minimum time required is max(5,4)=5max(5, 4) = 5max(5,4)=5 units."
