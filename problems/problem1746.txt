b'Problem\n\xc2\xa0\nOne night Mr.X and Mr.Y were playing a game. To test Mr.Y\'s intelligence Mr.X gives him an interesting problem to solve.\nHe gives him a number N and asks him to\nswap the digits in the number such that a smallest number M is obtained without leading zeroes. Mr.Y thinks this is an easy problem to solve and immediately gives the answer.\nThe number can be large therefore Mr.X wants to check Mr.Y\'s answer by writing a program for this problem.\nSince Mr.X is not so good in programming therefore he asks for your help in doing so.\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains T, the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer N without leading zeroes.\nThe second line will contain one integer M \xe2\x80\x94 Mr.Y\'s answer.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\n\nFor each test case output "AC" if Mr.Y\'s answer is correct, otherwise "WA" (without quotes).\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\nShould contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n2\n310\n103\n1\n2\nOutput:\nAC\nWA\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nSelf Explanatory'
