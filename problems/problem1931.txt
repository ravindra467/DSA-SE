b"Problem\nIn the city of Tokyo, there are NNN houses spread throughout the city labelled from 111 to NNN. Some houses are used by HUMANS while some are used by GHOULS( a demon-like being or monstrous humanoid originating in pre-Islamic Arabian religion). Two houses are connected with each other through a road.\nTo maintain the diversity and restrain the population from creating a group with same kind of being, the government of Tokyo has a strict rule known as Human Ghoul Neighbouring.\nHuman Ghoul Neighbouring Rule : No two same type of species should have neighbouring directly connected houses. ( Suppose house 1 is occupied by human then all the houses that are connected from 1 should be of Ghoul\xe2\x80\x99s and vice versa)\nInitially the NNN houses of Tokyo city is connected and has exactly N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 roads (No self loop or cycles) in the map following the government rule of Human Ghoul Neighbouring.\r\nYou just got a well paid job in Tokyo government. Because of limited number of roads there is too much rush on the road your job is to construct new roads in the city without violating Human Ghoul Neighbouring Rule.\nYou are given the NNN houses and the way they are connected initially. You have to find the number of maximum roads you can add in the city such that the Human Ghoul Neighbouring rule keeps maintained. But due to privacy policies you are not given details of which house contains which species.\nFind the maximum number of additional road you can construct in the city of Tokyo.\n\nNote : After adding new roads it may contain cycles, you just need to take care of the Human Ghoul Neighbouring Rule.\n\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain NNN, denoting number of houses.\nNext N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains interger uuu and vvv denoting there is a road between house uuu and house vvv\n\nOutput:\nOutput a single integer - The maximum number of additional road you can add in the city\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq u,v \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\n\nSample Input 1:\n3\r\n1 2\r\n1 3\n\nSample Output 1:\n0\n\nSample Input 2:\n4\r\n1 2\r\n1 4\r\n4 3\n\nSample Output 2:\n1\n\nEXPLANATION:\nIn case 1: houses can be [G, H, G] or [H, G, H] (H and G stands for Human and Ghoul in the i'th house). We can not add any new road in the map otherwise the Human Ghoul Neighbouring Rule will be broken, hence answer is 000.\nIn case 2 : You can create a road between house number 2 and house number 3, hence answer is 111"
