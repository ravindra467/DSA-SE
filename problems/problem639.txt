b'Problem\nBob has n heap(s) of gravel (initially there are exactly c piece(s) in each). He wants to do m operation(s) with that heaps, each maybe:\nadding pieces of gravel onto the heaps from u to v, exactly k pieces for each,\nor querying "how many pieces of gravel are there in the heap p now?".\nRequest\nHelp Bob do operations of the second type.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains the integers n,m,c, respectively.\nm following lines, each forms:\nS u v k to describe an operation of the first type.\nQ p to describe an operation of the second type.\n(Each integer on a same line, or between the characters S, Q and the integers is separated by at least one space character)\nOutput\nFor each operation of the second type, output (on a single line) an integer answering to the respective query (follows the respective Input order).\nLimitations\n0<n\xe2\x89\xa4106\n0<m\xe2\x89\xa4250 000\n0<u\xe2\x89\xa4v\xe2\x89\xa4n\n0\xe2\x89\xa4c,k\xe2\x89\xa4109\n0<p\xe2\x89\xa4n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput7 5 0\nQ 7\nS 1 7 1\nQ 3\nS 1 3 1\nQ 30\n1\n2'
