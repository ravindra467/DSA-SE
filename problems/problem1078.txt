b'Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\n\nThere is a rectangular grid of cells consisting of n rows and m columns.\nYou will place a robot on one of the grid cells and provide it with a command string s, consisting of characters \xe2\x80\x98L\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98R\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98U\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98D\xe2\x80\x99.\nAfter being placed, the robot will follow the instructions of the command string, where \'L\' corresponds moving to the left, \'R\' towards the right, \'U\' for moving up, and \'D\' means down.\n\n\nYou have already selected the command string s, and are wondering if it is possible to place the robot in one of the grid cells initially and have it always stay entirely within the grid upon execution of the command string s.\nOutput \xe2\x80\x9csafe\xe2\x80\x9d if there is a starting cell for which the robot doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fall off the grid on following command s, otherwise, output "unsafe".\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input will contain an integer T, the number of test cases.\n\n\nEach test case will be on two lines. \n\n\nThe first line will have two space separated integers n,m. \n\n\nThe second line will have the command string s.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output "safe" (without quotes) or "unsafe" (without quotes) in a new line.\n\nConstraints\n\n 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 1,000\n 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n,m \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 |s| \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput5\n1 1\nR\n2 3\nLLRU\n3 2\nLLRU\n4 3\nULURUDRDLD\n3 6\nRURURunsafe\nsafe\nunsafe\nsafe\nsafe\nExplanation:\n\nFor the first case, there is only one grid square, so we must place our robot there. When the robot follows the command, it\'ll fall off, so it is unsafe.\n\n\nFor the second case, we can place the robot on the bottom right grid square. Here is an image denoting the moves that the robot will make.\n\n'
