b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.\nConsider a rooted tree. A leaf in this tree is a vertex that does not have any children. Suppose that we perform a depth-first search from the root and write down the numbers of all leaves in the order in which they are visited. Since the order of visiting the sons of any vertex during the search is not fixed, many different sequences of leaves may be created. We call a subset of all leaves good if it is non-empty and there is at least one sequence of leaves such that the leaves from this subset (in some order) form its contiguous subsequence.\nYou are given a tree with NNN vertices numbered 111 through NNN. You should answer QQQ queries. In each query, you are given a vertex RRR and a set of leaves SSS; you should find out whether SSS is a good set when the tree is rooted at RRR.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers NNN and QQQ.\nEach of the next N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two space-separated integers uuu and vvv describing an edge in the tree.\nThe next QQQ lines describe queries. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers RRR and KKK, followed by a space and KKK space-separated integers s1,s2,\xe2\x80\xa6,sKs_1, s_2, \\dots, s_Ks1\xe2\x80\x8b,s2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,sK\xe2\x80\x8b denoting the leaves in SSS.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, print a single line containing the string "YES" if the given set is good or "NO" otherwise.\nConstraints\n\n3\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851053 \\le N \\le 5 \\cdot 10^53\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851051 \\le Q \\le 5 \\cdot 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le R \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le K \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4si\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le s_i \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4si\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid iii\nall elements of SSS are distinct leaves\nvertex RRR has at least two adjacent vertices\nthe sum of KKK over all queries does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x851055 \\cdot 10^55\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nExample Input\n10 2\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n2 5\n2 6\n3 7\n3 8\n4 9\n4 10\n1 2 9 10\n1 3 5 7 9\n\nExample Output\nYES\nNO\n'
