b'Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef taught his brother Chefu about right angled triangle and its properties. Chefu says that he has understood everything about right angled triangles. Chef wants to check learning of his brother by asking the following question "Can you find a right angled triangle whose length of hypotenuse  is H and its area is S?"\nChefu is confused how to solve it. I hope you are not. Please solve this by finding a right angled triangle with hypotenuse H and area S. If it not possible to do so, then output -1.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test-cases. T test cases follow.\nFor each test case, there will be a single line containing two space separated integers H and S.\nOutput\nOutput the answer for each test-case in a single line. If it is not possible to find such a triangle, output -1. Otherwise print 3 real numbers corresponding to the lengths of the sides of the triangle sorted in non-decreasing order. Please note that the length of the triangle sides should not differ by more than 0.01 in absolute value from the correct lengths.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 H \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 S \xe2\x89\xa4 1012\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4\n5 6\n6 10\n258303 89837245228\n616153 778781454663.00000 4.00000 5.00000\n-1\n-1\n285168.817674 546189.769984 616153.000000'
