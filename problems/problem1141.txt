b'Problem\n\xc2\xa0\nProblem description\nKamaldeep came across a new way to represent a string.This is done by writing each segment of identical characters as the character and the length of the segment.\nFor example the string str = "XXXZZZZZPP" can be represented as [ (\'X\', 3), (\'Z\', 5), (\'P\', 2) ].\nIn this notation,two consecutive pairs cannot have same character. For example [(\'T\', 4), (\'T\', 3)] is invalid and its correct representation is [(\'T\', 7)]. Kamaldeep has written down a string in given representation, and he wants to count the number of sub-strings (a segment of consecutive characters) of the original string that are palindromes.\nRecall that a palindrome is a non-empty string that reads the same backward as forward. Two sub-strings are considered to be different if they have different lengths or start at different positions in the original string.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer M denoting the number of test cases. The description of M test cases follows.\nEach test case gives a string in the above representation. The first line of each test case contains an integer N, the number of (character, integer) pairs in the given representation. Each of the next N lines contains a single character, followed by a space, followed by a positive integer, the kth line being the kth pair in the list..\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the corresponding answer.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 10^4\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 10^5\n\nEach character is an upper-case Latin character, i.e. \'A\' through \'Z\'.\nThe length of the original string does not exceed 1,000,000,000 (10^9)\nThe sum of the Ns over all test cases will not exceed 1,000,000 (10^6)\nExample\nInput:\n4\n3\nL 3\nZ 2\nA 3\n3\nO 2\nB 1\nA 2\n1\nS 11\n2\nI 4\nP 2\nOutput:\n15\n7\n66\n13\n'
