b'Problem\n\xc2\xa0\n\nAfter a long series of jobless days, Sherlock and Watson frustated by the lack of new cases, decide to turn their minds toward something interesting like solving few logical problems. One of the problems they have to solve now is as follows:\nGiven an array A of size N and a list of Q number of queries, where each query has two numbers L and R, find for each query the number of inversions in the subarray from Lth to Rth position (both inclusive) of the array A( array has 1-based index).\nFor an array A two elements A[i] and A[j] form an inversion if A[i] > A[j] and i < j. Help them to solve this problem.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\n\nFirst line contains a single integer, length N of the array.\nSecond line has N space separated numbers, where ith element is A[i].\nThird line has a single integer Q.\nNext Q lines have 2 space separated integers L and R of that query.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput Q lines, ith line having a single integer, the answer to the ith query\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 20000\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 A[i] \xe2\x89\xa4 10^9\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xe2\x89\xa4 20000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 L \xe2\x89\xa4 R \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n\n7\n7 9 3 5 1 6 4\n4\n1 4\n3 5\n1 2\n1 7\n\nOutput:\n\n4\n2\n0\n14\n\n'
