b'Problem\nGotham city is in danger. All the people from Gotham were airlifted and they are going to be dropped at different districts of a new safe city.\nThere are NNN districts located at position (1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,N)(1, 2, \\ldots, N)(1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,N) in a straight line in this newly built safe city.\r\nAn array(P) is given which tells us about the maximum capacity of people that can be accommodated in the districts.\nThere is a condition that people can move only in the forward direction(i.e from city iii to i+1i+1i+1 for 1\xe2\x89\xa4i<N1 \\leq i \\lt N1\xe2\x89\xa4i<N) to get shelter.\r\nPeople want to travel as little as possible to get shelter.\r\nThe sad part is that in case any person who does not get shelter is going to die.\nInitially, all the districts in the new city are empty.\nYou are asked QQQ queries.\n\nEach query consists of two Integers XXX and KKK, where KKK denotes the number of people who are going to be dropped at district XXX.\nYou are required to print the total sum of distance traveled by the people in the current query(that got shelter or did not die) in a new line.\n\nNote:- Queries are not independent(they depend on the previous queries).\nInput\n\nFirst Line consists of one Integer NNN, where NNN is the number of districts.\nSecond line consists of NNN integers of (array P) separated by a space.\nThird Line contains an integer QQQ, which denotes the number of queries.\nNext, QQQ lines consist of two integers XXX and KKK separated by space.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each query, you have to print the total sum of distance traveled by the people in the current query(that got shelter or did not die ) in a new line.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq Q \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq X \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4P[i]\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq P[i] \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4P[i]\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq K \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nExample Input\n4\r\n5 5 6 1\r\n2\r\n2 11\r\n2 3\n\nExample Output\n6\r\n2\n\nExplanation\n\nQuery 111: 555 people will get shelter in city 222 and the remaining 666 will get shelter in city 333. So, the total distance covered in this query is 666.\nQuery 222: Only 111 person can get shelter in city 444 and the rest will die. So, the total distance traveled is 222.\n'
