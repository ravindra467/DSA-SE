b"Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nSometimes, the stability of a stock market is at least as important as rapid price changes.\nLet a stable block be a maximal consecutive block of days with same stock prices.\nMoreover, let a stable block of order K be a stable block of length at least K.\nFor example, if stock prices for 7 consecutive days are: 20, 10, 10, 7, 7, 7, 10, then there are 4 stable blocks there: [20], [10, 10], [7, 7, 7] and [10]. Moreover, there are:\n\n\n0 stable blocks of order 4 or higher\n1 stable block of order 3: [7, 7, 7]\n2 stable block of order 2: [10, 10], [7, 7, 7]\n4 stable block of order 1: [20], [10, 10], [7, 7, 7] and [10]\n\n\nGiven historical prices of a stock across N days, the goal is to answer Q customers' questions.\nThe i-th question contains three integers Li, Ri and Ki. It asks for the number of stable blocks of order Ki, if only the stock prices of the days in the range Li, Ri are considered.\nInput\n\nIn the first line there is a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases to handle. After that the description of T test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and Q, denoting respectively, the number of days for which the stock prices are given, and the number of questions to answer.\n\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN, where Ai denotes the price of the stock on the i-th day. \n\n\nQ lines follow. In the i-th of them there are three space-separated integers Li, Ri and Ki denoting the i-th query.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print answers to all queries in the test case, one per line.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 5\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, Q \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Li \xe2\x89\xa4 Ri \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ki \xe2\x89\xa4 Ri - Li + 1\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1: (10 points)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, Q \xe2\x89\xa4 3000\n\n\n\nSubtask #2: (90 points)\n\noriginal constraints\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n8 5\n20 10 10 10 7 7 7 10\n2 6 2\n3 6 2\n3 6 3\n3 8 3\n3 8 1\n3 2\n27 27 27\n1 3 1\n2 2 12\n2\n0\n1\n3\n1\n1\nExplanation:\nThere are two test cases to handle\nTest case #1:\nThere are 8 days for which prices are given and 5 queries to handle.\nThe first query asks for the number of stable blocks of order 2 in range [2, 6], which corresponds to prices 10 10 10 7 7. The answer is 2 because there are two such blocks: 10 10 10 and 7 7.\nThe second query asks for the number of stable blocks of order 2 in range [3, 6], which corresponds to prices 10 10 7 7. The answer is 2 because there are two such blocks: 10 10 and 7 7.\nThe third query asks for the number of stable blocks of order 3 in range [3, 6], which corresponds to prices 10 10 7 7. The answer is 0 because there is no stable block of order 3 there (maximum order of a stable block is 2).\nThe fourth query asks for the number of stable blocks of order 3 in range [3, 8], which corresponds to prices 10 10 7 7 7 10. The answer is 1 because the only stable block of order 3 here is 7 7 7.\nThe fifth query asks for the number of stable blocks of order 1 in range [3, 8], which corresponds to prices 10 10 7 7 7 10. The answer is 3 because there are 3 stable blocks of order 1 there: 10 10, 7 7 7 and 10.\nTest case #2:\nThere are 3 days for which prices are given and 2 queries to handle.\nThe first query asks for the number of stable blocks of order 1 in range [1, 3], which corresponds to prices 27 27 27. The answer is 1 because the only such block there is 27 27 27.\nThe second query asks for the number of stable blocks of order 1 in range [2, 2], which corresponds to a single price 27. The answer is 1 because the only such block there is 27."
