b'Problem\nThere are NNN villages numbered 111 to NNN. The villages are connected through bi-directional paths in between them. The whole network is in the form of a tree.\nEach village has only 111 fighter but they help each other in times of crisis by sending their fighter to the village in danger through paths along the villages. Defeating a fighter will mean conquering his village. In particular, If village XXX is under attack, all villages having a path to XXX will send their fighters for help.\nNaruto wants to conquer all the villages. But he cannot take on so many fighters at the same time so he plans to use  a secret technique with which he can destroy  any 111 village (along with paths connected to it) in the blink of an eye.  However, it can be used only once. He realized that if he destroys any village, say XXX, the maximum number of fighters he has to fight at once reduces to WWW. He wants WWW to be as small as possible. Help him find the optimal XXX.\nIn case of multiple answers, choose the smallest value of XXX.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nFirst Line contains NNN.\nNext N\xe2\x88\x921N - 1N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contain U,VU, VU,V, denoting a path between village UUU and VVV.\n\nOutput:\n\nFor each Test case, print in a new line, optimal XXX and corresponding value of WWW.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq T \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n3\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41053 \\leq N \\leq 10^53\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4U,V\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq U, V \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4U,V\xe2\x89\xa4N\nU!=VU != VU!=V\n\nSample Input:\n2\r\n5\r\n1 2\r\n1 3\r\n2 4\r\n3 5\r\n3\r\n1 2\r\n2 3\n\nSample Output:\n1 2\r\n2 1\n\nEXPLANATION:\nSample 1:  By destroying village 111,  The fighters Naruto will be fighting at the same time will be from villages [2,4][2, 4][2,4] and [3,5][3, 5][3,5].  For this WWW = 222. No other choice can give lesser WWW. Hence 111 is optimal choice.'
