b'Problem\n\nThere are N lights above a road along the X-axis.\nThe i-th light has Xi as its X-coordinate, and it is hung Yi above the road.\nThe i-th light illuminates a triangular area, which is an isosceles triangle and its bottom edge is on the X-axis.\nThe half of the top angle of the triangle is Zi degrees. (See the below figure)\n\n\nYou have an aircraft which can fly on a fixed height.\nBecause of some unknown reasons, this aircraft can fly only under the light.\nYour task is to find the maximum possible height for your flight from X=L to X=R.\n\n\nThe lights do not block the aircraft, e.g. the aircraft can safely fly through a light.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three parameters N, L and R.\n\n\nThe next N lines give the infomation about each light.\nThe i-th line contains three numbers Xi, Yi and Zi.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput the maximum height you can reach.\nThe value must have an absolute error less than or equal to 0.000001 (10-6).\nIt is guarenteed that you can make the flight with the positive height.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 50000\n-1000 \xe2\x89\xa4 L < R \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n-1000 \xe2\x89\xa4 Xi \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n0 < Yi \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n15 \xe2\x89\xa4 Zi \xe2\x89\xa4 75N is an integer, but all other input values can be non-integers.\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2 3.2 7.3\n3.2 4.7 28\n7.3 4.2 753.300759642'
