b'Problem\nRead problems statements Mandarin , Bengali , Hindi , Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nArya and Aryan live in a country called Nadaca. Nadaca consists of NNN cities numbered 111 through NNN, which are connected by some bidirectional roads. Each road has a positive (not necessarily integer) length. Arya lives in city 111 and Aryan lives in city NNN.\nArya claims that for each city vvv, the shortest path from city 111 to city vvv has length ava_vav\xe2\x80\x8b. Aryan does not disagree, but claims that for each city vvv, the shortest path from city NNN to city vvv has length bvb_vbv\xe2\x80\x8b. You are the wisest person they know, so they asked you to tell them if it is possible for their claims to be true, i.e. if a road network which fully satisfies their claims exists. Help them!\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases.
