b'Problem\nToday, Ram and friends have come out to play.\nRam has brought a Frisbee for today\'s game!\nRam has NNN friends numbered from 111 to NNN , and they decided to play for XXX minutes.\nThe game\'s rules are as follows:\n\nAll players stand in a circle.\nRam starts the game and passes the frisbee to one (it can be anyone) of his friends.\nAny player who recieves the frisbee is free to pass the frisbee towards any other player immediately (no time gap).\nThe frisbee takes 111 minute to go from one player to another (regardless of the distance).\nThe game will end after XXX minutes have completed (the frisbee recieved at the end of the last minute is counted).\n\nThey will be happy if before the end of the game , every player has interacted with the other NNN players at least once.\nRecieving and passing frisbee both count as interactions.\nEx- If player AAA passes the frisbee to player BBB,\nit can be said that player AAA has interacted with player BBB and player BBB has interacted with player AAA as well.\nNote: Total number of players is N+1N+1N+1 (including Ram himself).\nGiven NNN and XXX , you are to print if Ram and friends will be happy or not.\n### Input:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nEach testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers N,XN, XN,X.\n\n### Output:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line "Happy" if they will complete the game before the end else  print "Unhappy" if they won\'t be able to complete the game before the end.\n### Constraints \n- 1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq T \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n- 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100001 \\leq N \\leq 100001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410000\n- 1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq X \\leq 10^9 1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4109\n### Sample Input:\n\t2\n\t2 2\n\t2 3\n### Sample Output:\n\tUnhappy\n\tHappy\n\t### EXPLANATION:\nIn the first case there are a total of 3 people and time left is 2 minutes, \nSo it\'s not possible for every player to interact with the other 2 players.\nIn the second case there are a total of 3 people and time left is 3 minutes,\nSo it\'s possible for every player to interact with the other 2 players.\nOne possible way is [Ram->1, 1->2, 2->Ram].'
