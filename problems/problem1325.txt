So the ever hard-working Municipal Body of Kamothe has come up with a proposal of setting up a huge tank having capacity V for the purpose of rainwater harvesting. They have planned for a trial period of N days.\nUsing tech from the future, the Meteorological Department has predicted the exact amount of rainfall for each day Ai where 1 \xe2\x89\xa4  i \xe2\x89\xa4 N.\nThe municipal body has appointed a responsible but lazy citizen of Kamothe, Mr. Shivam Pawase to transfer water from the tank when it overflows.\nThey have not yet decided the capacity of the tank but Shivam wants to know on which days since the beginning of the trial period he would have to be at the facility to transfer the water from the tank, once the tank is full if the capacity of the tank is V. Shivam only wants to go to the facility at the end of the day. The transfer of water happens instantaneously.\nNote: If there is no day when he must visit, i.e the tank never overflows, output 0 0\nInput:\n\nFirst Line contains Number of Test Cases: T\nFor each test case:\n\nFirst line contains Length of trial period and number of periods(space separated): N and Q\nSecond Line contains List of Amount of rainfall on each day i: Ai\nFor each query for Q queries, on new line:\n\nCapacity of Tank: V\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput:\n\nFor each query, output the number of days and last day from the start of the trial period when Shivam has to visit the facility to transfer the contents of the tank.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 365\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 1500\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n10000 \xe2\x89\xa4 V \xe2\x89\xa4 20000\n\nExample### Input\n2\n17 3\n1500 1500 1500 1500 1000 1000 1000 1500 1500 1000 1000 1500 1500 1500 1000 1000 1500\n10000\n12000\n15000 \n6 1\n500 600 700 800 900 1000\n10000\n\nOutput\n2 14\n1 9\n1 11\n0 0\n\nExplanation:\nFor the 1st testcase\nWhen V = 10000, he must visit twice, first at the end of the 7th day, otherwise it would overflow on the 8th day. He transfer all the water collected so far somewhere else.\nThen must visit at the end of the 14th day.\nWhen V = 12000, He must visit only once( At the end of 9th day)\nWhen V = 15000, He must visit only once( At the end of 11th day)'
