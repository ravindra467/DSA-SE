b"Problem\n\xc2\xa0\nPari appeared for a job interview and is asked the following question. Arrange all the distinct substrings of a given string in lexicographical order and concatenate them. Print the Kth character of the concatenated string. It is assured that given value of K will be valid i.e. there will be a Kth character. Can you help Pari out with this?\nNote We have distinct substrings here, i.e. if string is aa, it's distinct substrings are a and aa.\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\nFirst line will contain a number T i.e. number of test cases. \nFirst line of each test case will contain a string containing characters (a-z)  and second line will contain a number K.\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\nPrint Kth  character ( the string is 1 indexed )\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 5\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 length \xe2\x89\xa4 105\nK will be an appropriate integer.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n1\ndbac\n3\nOutput:\nc\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nThe substrings when arranged in lexicographic order are as follows :\n a, ac, b, ba, bac, c, d, db, dba, dbac \n\nOn concatenating them, we get :\n aacbbabaccddbdbadbac\n\nThe third character in this string is c and hence the answer."
