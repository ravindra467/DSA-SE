b'Problem\nThere are NNN boxes with not necessarily distinct heights and widths which are placed in a single line.\r\nAmit and Saurav, are very competitive friends, they try to compete with each other in petty things. Amit and Saurav both start the game from different ends of the line. (Amit went to the left end and Saurav went to the right end of the line) and played a game, whosoever will travel the maximum distance(sum of widths of the boxes travelled) will win the game.\nThere are restrictions for both of them in the game. They were as follows:-\n\nAmit can only travel to boxes whose height is greater than the current box.\nSaurav can only travel to boxes whose height is greater than or equal to the current box.\n\nEach player will start their game with the original lineup of boxes and can remove any number of boxes from the path in their respective turns in order to overcome their limitations.\nThe game proceeds as follows:-\n\nFirst of all, Amit will play the game from the left end and notes down the maximum distance he travelled from the left end.\nAfter that, Saurav will play the game from the right end and notes down the maximum distance he travelled from the right end.\n\nYour task is to find out who will win the game and what was distance (sum of widths of the boxes)  travelled by the winner.\nPlease Note:- In case of the same distance travelled by both of them, Amit will be declared as a winner.\nInput:\n\nFirst-line will contain TTT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nFirst line of each test case will contain a single integer NNN.\nSecond line, will contain NNN spaced integers h1,h2,h3,\xe2\x80\xa6..hN{h_{1}, h_{2}, h_{3}, \xe2\x80\xa6.. h_{N}}h1\xe2\x80\x8b,h2\xe2\x80\x8b,h3\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6..hN\xe2\x80\x8b , telling the heights of the boxes.\nThird line, will contain NNN spaced integers w1,w2,w3,\xe2\x80\xa6..wN{w_{1}, w_{2}, w_{3}, \xe2\x80\xa6.. w_{N}}w1\xe2\x80\x8b,w2\xe2\x80\x8b,w3\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6..wN\xe2\x80\x8b , telling the widths of the boxes.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case,\nOutput two lines:-\n\nFirst-line will contain the name of the winner i.e. \xe2\x80\x98Amit\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98Saurav\xe2\x80\x99 (without quotes)\nSecond-line will contain the distance ( sum of widths of the boxes used ) travelled by the winner.\n\nPlease Note- The Output is case-sensitive.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq T \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4hi,wi\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq h_{i}, w_{i} \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4hi\xe2\x80\x8b,wi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\nSum of NNN over all testcases does not exceed 10510^5105\n\nSample Input:\n3\r\n4\r\n40 70 65 40\r\n20 10 40 55\r\n3\r\n82 79 81\r\n15 20 20\r\n3\r\n79 80 80\r\n20 20 20\n\nSample Output:\nSaurav\r\n105\r\nAmit\r\n40\r\nAmit\r\n40\n'
