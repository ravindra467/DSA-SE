b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Bengali as well.\nA tree is defined as a connected, undirected graph with nnn vertices and n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 edges. The distance between two vertices in a tree is equal to the number of edges on the unique simple path between them.\nYou are given two integers xxx and yyy. Construct a tree with the following properties:\n\nThe number of pairs of vertices with an even distance between them equals xxx.\nThe number of pairs of vertices with an odd distance between them equals yyy.\n\nBy a pair of vertices, we mean an ordered pair of two (possibly, the same or different) vertices.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. Each test case consists of one line containing two space-separated integers xxx and yyy.\nOutput\nFor each test case, if there is no tree satisfying the given properties, print "NO" (without quotes).\nOtherwise, on the first line print "YES" (without quotes). Then print integer nnn denoting the number of vertices in the tree, followed by n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921n\xe2\x88\x921 lines describing the edges of the tree in any order. Vertices are numbered from 111 to nnn. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq T \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq x,y \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4109\nx+y\xe2\x89\xa4109x + y \\leq 10^9x+y\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nExample Input\n4\r\n2 2\r\n29 20\r\n3 12\r\n6 3\n\nExample Output\nYES\r\n2\r\n1 2\r\nYES\r\n7\r\n1 2\r\n1 3\r\n2 4\r\n2 5\r\n3 6\r\n3 7\r\nNO\r\nNO\n\nExplanation\nIn the first test case,  the pairs (1,1)(1 ,1)(1,1) and (2,2)(2 ,2)(2,2) have an even distance, while the pairs (1,2)(1 ,2)(1,2) and (2,1)(2 ,1)(2,1) have an odd distance.'
