b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nDr.D got so famous thanks to his first problem that he decided to commemorate it by making yet another problem with an almost identical statement \xe2\x80\x94 he only changed one word.\nWe want to choose exactly two integers (not necessarily distinct) from the interval [L,R][L, R][L,R]. Find the maximum possible value of the bitwise OR of the chosen integers.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers LLL, RRR.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum bitwise OR.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le T \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa410180 \\le L \\le R \\le 10^{18}0\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa41018\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4\n1 3\n4 5\n1031 93714\n1000000000123 10000001234563\n5\n131071\n1000000192511'
