b'Problem\nAfter the first chemistry lesson, Ron realized that the simplest way to compress a string of Latin characters is to write it down as a list of pairs of character and integer. This is done by writing each segment of identical characters as the character and the length of the segment. For example, the string s = "AABBBCCCC" can be compressed as  [ (\'A\', 2), (\'B\', 3), (\'C\', 4)]. In compressed notation, two consecutive pairs cannot have same character. For example [(\'A\', 2), (\'A\', 4)] is invalid and its correct representation is [(\'A\', 6)]. Ron has written down a string in compressed notation, and he wants to count the number of sub-strings (a segment of consecutive characters) of the original string that are palindromes.\nRecall that a palindrome is a non-empty string that reads the same backward as forward. Two sub-strings are considered to be different if they have different lengths or start at different positions in the original string.\nInput:\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of  T test cases follows.\nEach test case gives a string in compressed notation. The first line of each test case contains an integer K, the number of (character, integer) pairs in compressed notation.\nEach of the next k lines contains a single character, followed by a space, followed by a positive integer, the ith line being the ith pair in the list\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the corresponding answer.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4\xc2\xa0T\xc2\xa0\xe2\x89\xa4\xc2\xa010,000(104)\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4\xc2\xa0K\xc2\xa0\xe2\x89\xa4\xc2\xa0100,000(105)\n\n\nEach character is an upper-case Latin character, i.e. \'A\' through \'Z\'.\n\n\nSample Input:\n3\n2\nA 2\nB 2\n3\nA 2\nB 1\nA 2\n1\nA 11\nSample Output:\n6\n9\n66\n### EXPLANATION:\n\nExample case 1: The original string is AABB so the sub-strings (represented by positions of the first and the last character) which are palindromes are (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4) and (4, 4).\nExample case 2:  The original string is AABAA. The sub-strings that are palindromes are the 4 sub-strings A, the 2 sub-strings AA and the sub-strings B, ABA and AABAA. Together, they make 9 palindromes.\nExample case 3: The original string is A repeated 11 times, so all the sub-strings are palindromes.'
