b'Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese , Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nSergey has made N measurements. Now, he wants to know the average value of the measurements made.\nIn order to make the average value a better representative of the measurements, before calculating the average, he wants first to remove the highest K and the lowest K measurements. After that, he will calculate the average value among the remaining N - 2K measurements.\nCould you help Sergey to find the average value he will get after these manipulations?\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K denoting the number of measurements and the number of the greatest and the lowest values that will be removed.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the measurements. \nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the average value after removing K lowest and K greatest measurements.\nYour answer will be considered correct, in case it has absolute or relative error, not exceeding 10-6.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 104\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 2K < N\n-106 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 (50 points): K = 0\nSubtask #2 (50 points): no additional constraints\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n5 1\n2 9 -10 25 1\n5 0\n2 9 -10 25 1\n3 1\n1 1 14.000000\n5.400000\n1.000000\nExplanation:\nExample case 1. After removing 1 greatest and 1 lowest measurement, we get the set {2, 9, 1}. The average value in this set is (2+9+1)/3=4.\nExample case 2. The average value in the set {2, 9, -10, 25, 1} is (2+9-10+25+1)/5=5.4.\nExample case 3. After removing the 1 largest and smallest measurements, Sergey will be left with only one measurement, i.e. 1. Average of this is 1 itself.'
