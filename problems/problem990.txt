b"Problem\nLet's suppose a thief enters in Chef's home at the party night  and he has CCC capacity to take the items with him. In the Chef home, there are NNN number of different items of W1,W2...WnW1, W2 ... WnW1,W2...Wn weights and can give profit of P1,P2...PnP1, P2 ... PnP1,P2...Pn respectively. Since the thief is very intelligent so he will make the maximum profit with less effort.\r\nSince the Chef is busy in other arrangement and you are the Chef's best friend. So you have to find the total loss to file an FIR.\nNote:Note:Note: Breaking of the item is allowed and print the final output as Integer value after rounding-off the value.\nInput:\n\nFirst-line will contain TTT, the number of test cases.\nEach test case contains three lines of input.\nFirst line contains, two integers N,CN, CN,C.\nSecond line contains, W1,W2...WnW1, W2 ... WnW1,W2...Wn.\nThird line contains, P1,P2...PnP1, P2 ... PnP1,P2...Pn.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, output in a single line loss of Chef.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq T \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\leq N \\leq 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4C\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\leq C \\leq 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4C\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4W[i],P[i]\xe2\x89\xa41071 \\leq W[i], P[i] \\leq 10^71\xe2\x89\xa4W[i],P[i]\xe2\x89\xa4107\n\nSample Input:\n1\n3 5\n1 2 3\n10 20 30\nSample Output:\n50\nEXPLANATION:\nThief will take the items with weight 3,23, 23,2 to make profit of  (30+20)=50(30 + 20) = 50(30+20)=50.\nHence Chef's loss will be 505050."
