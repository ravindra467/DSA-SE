b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\n"If you didn\'t copy assignments during your engineering course, did you even do engineering?"\nThere are QQQ students in Chef\'s class. Chef\'s teacher has given the students a simple assignment:\nWrite a function that takes as arguments an array AAA containing only unique elements and a number XXX guaranteed to be present in the array and returns the (111-based) index of the element that is equal to XXX.\nThe teacher was expecting a linear search algorithm, but since Chef is such an amazing programmer, he decided to write the following binary search function:\ninteger binary_search(array a, integer n, integer x):\n    integer low, high, mid\n    low := 1\n    high := n\n    while low \xe2\x89\xa4 high:\n        mid := (low + high) / 2\n        if a[mid] == x:\n            break\n        else if a[mid] is less than x:\n            low := mid+1\n        else:\n            high := mid-1\n    return mid\n\nAll of Chef\'s classmates have copied his code and submitted it to the teacher.\nChef later realised that since he forgot to sort the array, the binary search algorithm may not work. Luckily, the teacher is tired today, so she asked Chef to assist her with grading the codes. Each student\'s code is graded by providing an array AAA and an integer XXX to it and checking if the returned index is correct. However, the teacher is lazy and provides the exact same array to all codes. The only thing that varies is the value of XXX.\nChef was asked to type in the inputs. He decides that when typing in the input array for each code, he\'s not going to use the input array he\'s given, but an array created by swapping some pairs of elements of this original input array. However, he cannot change the position of the element that\'s equal to XXX itself, since that would be suspicious.\nFor each of the QQQ students, Chef would like to know the minimum number of swaps required to make the algorithm find the correct answer.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and QQQ denoting the number of elements in the array and the number of students.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\dots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b.\nThe following QQQ lines describe queries. Each of these lines contains a single integer XXX.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum required number of swaps, or \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible to make the algorithm find the correct answer.
