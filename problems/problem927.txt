b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Mandarin, Bengali, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b. Consider every pair that consists of:\n1)1)1) One of the longest non-decreasing subsequences of AAA.\n2)2)2) One of the longest non-increasing subsequences of AAA.\nFind the maximum possible length of the longest common subsequence of the two sequences in such a pair.\nInput Format\n\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\n\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer NNN.\n\n\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\n\nOutput Format\n\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the maximum possible length of the longest common subsequence of any longest non-decreasing subsequence of AAA and any longest non-increasing subsequence of AAA.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq T \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^{5}1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052 \\cdot 10^{5}2\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq A_i \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid iii\n\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 (20 points):\n\nT\xe2\x89\xa490T  \\leq 90T\xe2\x89\xa490\nN\xe2\x89\xa41000N \\leq 1000N\xe2\x89\xa41000\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 500050005000\nthe numbers in the sequence AAA are pairwise distinct\n\nSubtask #2 (20 points):\n\nT\xe2\x89\xa442T \\leq 42T\xe2\x89\xa442\nN\xe2\x89\xa41000N \\leq 1000N\xe2\x89\xa41000\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 500050005000\n\nSubtask #3 (60 points): original constraints\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4\n8\n6 5 1 2 7 8 4 3\n6\n1 6 5 2 3 4\n7\n2 5 3 3 1 3 7\n6\n6 1 4 2 4 50\n1\n3\n2\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: No pair of subsequences, containing one of the longest non-decreasing subsequences and one of longest non-increasing subsequences have a number in common. Hence, the answer is 000.\nExample case 2: The maximum length of the longest common subsequence is 111 and it can be achieved by choosing the longest non-decreasing subsequence {1,2,3,4}\\{1,2,3,4\\}{1,2,3,4} and the longest non-increasing subsequence {6,5,2}\\{6,5,2\\}{6,5,2}. The longest common subsequence of those two subsequences is {2}\\{2\\}{2}.\nExample case 3: The maximum length of the longest common subsequence is 333 and it can be achieved by choosing the longest non-decreasing subsequence {2,3,3,3,7}\\{2,3,3,3,7\\}{2,3,3,3,7} and the longest non-increasing subsequence {5,3,3,3}\\{5,3,3,3\\}{5,3,3,3}. The longest common subsequence of those two subsequences is {3,3,3}\\{3,3,3\\}{3,3,3}.\nExample case 4: The maximum length of the longest common subsequence is 222 and it can be achieved by choosing the longest non-decreasing subsequence {1,4,4,5}\\{1,4,4,5\\}{1,4,4,5} and the longest non-increasing subsequence {6,4,4}\\{6,4,4\\}{6,4,4}. The longest common subsequence of those two subsequences is {4,4}\\{4,4\\}{4,4}.'
