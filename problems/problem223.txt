b'Problem\nGiven a number n in one move you can either divide it by 5(if n%5==0) or subtract it by 3. You need to determine the minimum number of moves to make the n equal to 2, if this is not possible print -1.\nInput format\nThe first line contains t denotes the number of test cases.\nThe next t lines contains integer n.\nOutput format\nPrint minimum number of moves it takes to reach from n to 2 otherwise print -1.\nConstraint\n1<=t<=10^3\n1<=n<=10^6\nSample Input\n2\n12\n40\nSample Output\n-1\n3'
