b'Problem\nRead problems statements in mandarin chinese, russian and vietnamese as well.\n\nChef Ada loves trees, she thinks that the beauty of a tree is determined by the distance between its center and centroid. If the tree has multiple centers or centroids, then the beauty is the maximum among every possible pair.\n\n\nAs a reward for her delicious dishes (and awesome coding skills), CodeChef is going to give a present to Chef Ada, and of course it must be a tree! But not any tree, we want to give her one with n nodes, and beauty b. Help find such a tree.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains one number T, the number of test cases.\n\n\nEach test case contains two integers n and b, the desired number of vertices and beauty.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, if no tree satisfies the conditions print "NO" in a new line.\n\n\nOtherwise, print "YES" in a new line and describe any valid tree. Print n-1 more lines, each with two integers ui, vi (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 ui, vi \xe2\x89\xa4 n) denoting the indices of the vertices connected by an edge in the tree.\n\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 104\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 b \xe2\x89\xa4 n-1\nNotes\n\nA vertex u is a centroid if after removing u from the tree, the size of any of the resulting connected components is at most n/2.\n\n\nLef f(x) be the greatest distance from u to any other vertex of the tree. A vertex u is a center if f(u) \xe2\x89\xa4 f(v)  for any other vertex v.\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n4 0YES\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\nExplanation:\n\nVertex 1 is the center and centroid of the tree.\n'
