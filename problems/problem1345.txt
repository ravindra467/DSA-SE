Harry finishes eating the chocolates he has received on a particular day, on the same day itself. But uncle Sirius is also concerned that Harry might eat too many chocolates, so he has asked for your help.\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s how you can help:\r\nYou are given the number of chocolates Harry receives each day for N number of days starting from the very first day. Now you are given Q queries, in each query Uncle Sirius asks you the number of days Harry has taken to eat M chocolates in total.\n(Please note that each query contains a different number of M.)\n\nInput:\n\nFirst-line contains NNN and QQQ  , the number of days and the number of queries.\nSecond-line contains NNN integers, in which ith integer denotes the number of chocolates Harry has eaten on an ith day.\nThen the next line contains QQQ space-separated integers, MMM, where ith MMM denotes the ith query, i.e., the number of chocolates.\n\nOutput:\nFor each of the QQQ queries, you have to output the number of days Harry has taken to eat M chocolates in a new line.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x88\x971051 \\leq N,Q \\leq 5*10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x88\x97105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4array[i]\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq array[i] \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4array[i]\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41 \\leq M \\leq 1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4sum  of  all elements of the array\n\nSubtasks\n\n40 points : 1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa4201 \\leq N,Q \\leq 201\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa420\n60 points : OriginalOriginalOriginal constraints constraintsconstraints\n\nSample Input:\n    5 4\r\n    1 2 3 4 5\r\n    3 8 10 14\n\nSample Output:\n    2\r\n    4\r\n    4\r\n    5\n'
