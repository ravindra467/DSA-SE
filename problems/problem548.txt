b'Problem\n\nMr.D took her girlfriend on a date. He recently got placed so he wanted to give her so many gifts as he promised. He offered her n gifts with a condition that she must choose one gift from 4 consecutive gifts. Now our job is to find minimum cost that Mr.D must have to pay to buy those gifts.\n\nInput\n\nFirst line contains T, the number of test cases.\nEach test case consists of one integer N, number of gifts.\nNext line contains N integer separated by space, each integer denotes the cost of ith gift. \n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the required answer stated in the problem.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 <= T <= 10\n1 <= N <= 2 x 105\n1 <= Cost of Gift <= 109\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n4\n1 2 3 4\n7\n2 2 3 6 7 1 4\nOutput:\n1\n4\n\nExplanation\nFor second test case, divide the array in consecutive subarray of length 4:\n2 2 3 6\n2 3 6 7\n3 6 7 1\n6 7 1 4\nNow select 3rd gift having cost 3 from first subarray.\nNew subarray after selecting this gift:\n2 2 _ 6\n2 _ 6 7\n_ 6 7 1\n6 7 1 4\nNow since she had selected gift with cost 3, one gift had been selected from first three\nsubarray because cost 3 is common to first three subarray. Now, they are left with last subarray.\nSo, she selects the gift with cost 1.\nSo, the total cost of gifts is 4 which is minimum of all other possible scenario.\n'
