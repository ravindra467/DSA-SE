b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nTic-tac-toe is a game played between two players on a 3\xc3\x9733 \\times 33\xc3\x973 grid. In a turn, a player chooses an empty cell and places their symbol on the cell. The players take alternating turns, where the player with the first turn uses the symbol XXX and the other player uses the symbol OOO. The game continues until there is a row, column, or diagonal containing three of the same symbol (XXX or OOO), and the player with that token is declared the winner. Otherwise if every cell of the grid contains a symbol and nobody won, then the game ends and it is considered a draw.\nYou are given a tic-tac-toe board AAA after a certain number of moves, consisting of symbols OOO, XXX, and underscore(_\\__). Underscore signifies an empty cell.\nPrint\n\n111: if the position is reachable, and the game has drawn or one of the players won.\n222: if the position is reachable, and the game will continue for at least one more move.\n333: if the position is not reachable.\n\nNote:\n\nStarting from an empty board, reachable position means that the grid is possible after a finite number of moves in the game where the players may or may not be playing optimally.\nThe answer for each testcase should be with respect to the present position and independent of the results in the further successive moves.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer TTT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nEach test case contains 333 lines of input where each line contains a string describing the state of the game in ithi^{th}ith row.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output in a single line 111, 222 or 333 as described in the problem.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4391 \\leq T \\leq 3^91\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa439\nAij\xe2\x88\x88{X,O,_}A_{ij} \\in \\{X, O, \\_ \\}Aij\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\x88{X,O,_}\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): Original Constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\nXOX\nXXO\nO_O\nXXX\nOOO\n___\nXOX\nOX_\nXO_2\n3\n1\nExplanation:\nTest Case 111: The board is reachable, and although no player can win from this position, still the game continues.\nTest Case 222: There can't be multiple winners in the game.\nTest Case 333: The first player is clearly a winner with one of the diagonals."
