b'Problem\nProblem Statement:\nEuron loves to arrange things in order. Euron sticks to his \xe2\x80\x9cGolden rule\xe2\x80\x9d that every set of numbers must be in ascending order.\xc2\xa0 Unfortunately, that is not always the case. Euron defines a \xe2\x80\x9cviolation\xe2\x80\x9d as a situation when a smaller number comes after a larger number in the set, which violates the ascending order.\nGiven a set of integers, Euron needs to find out the total number of such violations.\nInput:\nThe first line contains n, the number of integers.\n\xc2\xa0The second line contains n space separated integers a0 \xe2\x80\xa6 an-1\nOutput:\nThe output is an integer indicating the total number of violations.\xc2\xa0\nConstraints:\n0 < n\xc2\xa0<= 105\n0 < ai < 108\nExample \xc2\xa0:\nInput:\n5\n4 5 6 7 1\nOutput :\n4\nExplanation :\n4, 5, 6 and 7 are in order.\n1 comes after 4, 5, 6, 7 on the list, but is smaller than all 4 of them. Hence 4 is the answer.\n\xc2\xa0\nInput :\n5\n5 4 3 2 1\nOutput :\n10'
