b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nYou are given a strictly convex polygon with NNN vertices (numbered 111 through NNN). For each valid iii, the coordinates of the iii-th vertex are (Xi,Yi)(X_i, Y_i)(Xi\xe2\x80\x8b,Yi\xe2\x80\x8b). You may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):\n\nConsider a parent polygon. Initially, this is the polygon you are given.\nDraw one of its child polygons \xe2\x80\x95 a simple non-degenerate polygon such that each of its sides is a chord of the parent polygon (it cannot be a side of the parent polygon). The operation cannot be performed if the parent polygon does not have any child polygons.\nThe child polygon which you drew becomes the new parent polygon.\n\nYour goal is to draw as many sides of polygons in total as possible (including the polygon given at the start). Find this maximum total number of sides.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nNNN lines follow. For each valid iii, the iii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers XiX_iXi\xe2\x80\x8b and YiY_iYi\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the maximum possible number of sides of polygons.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le T \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n3\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41053 \\le N \\le 10^53\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\xe2\x88\xa3Xi\xe2\x88\xa3,\xe2\x88\xa3Yi\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4109|X_i|, |Y_i| \\le 10^9\xe2\x88\xa3Xi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\xa3,\xe2\x88\xa3Yi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid iii\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851062 \\cdot 10^62\xe2\x8b\x85106\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n4\n-100 1\n0 2\n0 0\n100 1\n7\n-4 0\n-3 -2\n-3 2\n0 -4\n2 -3\n2 3\n3 24\n10\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: It is not possible to draw a child polygon.\nExample case 2: We can draw a child polygon once, e.g. with vertices (\xe2\x88\x923,\xe2\x88\x922)(-3, -2)(\xe2\x88\x923,\xe2\x88\x922), (\xe2\x88\x923,2)(-3, 2)(\xe2\x88\x923,2) and (3,2)(3, 2)(3,2). Even though there are several other ways to draw a child polygon, it can only be a triangle, so the total number of sides cannot exceed 7+3=107+3 = 107+3=10.'
