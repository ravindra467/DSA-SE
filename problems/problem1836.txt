b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nIn a red-blue tree, each vertex is either red or blue and adjacent vertices always have different colours.\nYou are given a tree with NNN vertices (numbered 111 through NNN). It is not necessarily a red-blue tree, but its vertices are still coloured red and blue. You may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero): choose two adjacent vertices and swap their colours.\nFind the smallest number of operations required to transform the tree into a red-blue tree or determine that it is impossible.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nN\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers uuu and vvv denoting that vertices uuu and vvv are connected by an edge.\nThe last line contains a string SSS with length NNN. For each valid iii, the iii-th character of this string is either \'0\' if the iii-th vertex is initially red or \'1\' if it is initially blue.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the smallest number of operations or \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible to transform the tree into a red-blue tree.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le T \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100,0001 \\le N \\le 100,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le u, v \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\nSSS contains only characters \'0\' and \'1\'\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 10610^6106\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1  \n7  \n1 2  \n1 3  \n2 4  \n2 5  \n3 6  \n3 7  \n00100103\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: We can perform the following operations:\n\nSwap the colours of vertices 111 and 333; the string of colours becomes "1000010".\nSwap the colours of vertices 111 and 222; the string of colours becomes "0100010".\nSwap the colours of vertices 666 and 333; the string of colours becomes "0110000", so the tree is a red-blue tree.\n'
