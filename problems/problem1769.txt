b'Problem\nSarthak has a set SSS of NNN distinct prime numbers. He grew very fond of that set, and now he only likes a positive integer XXX if all of its prime factors belong to SSS. Given the set and a positive integer MMM, can you find out how many integers he likes which are not more than MMM?\nNote: Sarthak always like the number 111.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of each input contains TTT - the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and MMM - the size of SSS and the limit defined in the statement.\nThe second line of each test case contains NNN space-separated integers S1,S2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SNS_1, S_2, \\dots, S_NS1\xe2\x80\x8b,S2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,SN\xe2\x80\x8b - the elements of SSS.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output on a single line the number of positive integers Sarthak likes that is not more than MMM.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa421 \\leq T \\leq 21\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4201 \\leq N \\leq 201\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa420\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa410161 \\leq M \\leq 10^{16}1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41016\n2\xe2\x89\xa4Si<10002 \\leq S_i \\lt 10002\xe2\x89\xa4Si\xe2\x80\x8b<1000\nSSS has NNN distinct prime numbers\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n2 10\n3 5\n4\nExplanation:\n\nTest case 111: Sarthak likes the numbers 111, 333, 555 and 999.\n'
