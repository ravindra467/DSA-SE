b"Problem\nGreed has an invincible shield due to which the attacks of Edward would not work on him. But Edward being a prodigy has caught onto the flaws in Greed's shield. The shield is made up of the same fundamental element, by which all other life forms are formed, Carbon.\nHe observed that Greed's shield can be represented as a grid GGG of carbon clusters with NNN rows and MMM columns. Each cell on the grid represents the orientation of the carbon cluster, either 000 or 111. Specifically, Gi,jG_{i, j}Gi,j\xe2\x80\x8b denote the jjj-th carbon cluster in iii-th row.\nThe shield is penetrable only when all the carbon clusters in the shield grid have the same orientation.\nFor achieving this, Initially, he chooses a single carbon cluster (ie. a single cell) in the shield. Now, he repeatedly applies the following move on this cluster, till all the carbon clusters in the grid have the same orientation:\nIn a single move, Edward flips the orientation of all clusters reachable from the chosen cluster. A cluster is called reachable from another cluster, if both clusters have the same orientation, and it is possible to move from one cluster to the other through clusters of that orientation only, moving vertically and horizontally. If earlier the orientation was 111, it turns into 000 and vice versa.\nChoosing the start cell optimally, can you find the minimum number of moves to make all the clusters have same orientation?\nDo not worry, you do not need to know about Carbon clusters in order to solve this problem.\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains TTT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nFor each test case, the first line contains NNN and MMM denoting the number of rows and columns of grid GGG depicting the shield of Greed.\nFor each test case, NNN lines follow, each line containing MMM integers where the jjj-th integer in iii-th line depicts the initial orientation of the Gi,jG_{i, j}Gi,j\xe2\x80\x8b cluster.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, output a single integer in a separate line denoting the minimum number of moves required to make the complete shield of a single orientation.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101\\leq T\\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4501 \\leq N,M \\leq 501\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa450\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Gi,j\xe2\x89\xa410 \\leq G_{i, j} \\leq 10\xe2\x89\xa4Gi,j\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa41 for 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq i \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N and 1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4M1 \\leq j \\leq M1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4M\n\nSample Input:\n4\r\n6 6\r\n0 0 0 1 1 1\r\n0 0 0 1 1 0\r\n0 0 0 0 0 0\r\n1 1 1 1 1 1\r\n1 1 0 0 0 0\r\n1 1 1 0 0 0\r\n4 3\r\n1 1 1\r\n1 1 1\r\n1 1 1\r\n1 1 1\r\n2 4\r\n0 0 0 0\r\n1 1 1 1\r\n1 5\r\n1 0 1 0 1\n\nSample Output:\n2\r\n0\r\n1\r\n2\n\nExplanation:\n\nTestcase 111: Choosing G1,1G_{1, 1}G1,1\xe2\x80\x8b as the start point, the whole shield gets orientation 000 in 222 moves.\n\nAfter the first move, the grid would look like:\n1 1 1 1 1 1\r\n1 1 1 1 1 1\r\n1 1 1 1 1 1\r\n1 1 1 1 1 1\r\n1 1 0 0 0 0\r\n1 1 1 0 0 0\n\nAfter the second move, the grid would look like:\n0 0 0 0 0 0\r\n0 0 0 0 0 0\r\n0 0 0 0 0 0\r\n0 0 0 0 0 0\r\n0 0 0 0 0 0\r\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThere are many other starting points which lead to the optimal minimal number of moves as well.\n\nTestcase 222: The shield is already of same orientation, so 000 moves.\nTestcase 333: Choosing G1,1G_{1, 1}G1,1\xe2\x80\x8b as the start point, the whole shield gets orientation 111 in 111 move.\nTestcase 444: Choosing G1,3G_{1, 3}G1,3\xe2\x80\x8b as the start point, the whole shield gets orientation 111 in 222 move.\n"
