b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef loves to make dishes. Currently, he has NNN ingredients (numbered 111 through NNN) which he can use to cook various dishes.\nTo make a dish, Chef must use exactly KKK ingredients in a correct order. Therefore, a dish is a sequence of KKK distinct integers between 111 and NNN. The tastiness of that dish is defined as the GCD of these integers (all the ingredients in that dish). Chef wants to choose a dish uniformly randomly and cook it.\nYou should answer QQQ queries. KKK is the same for all queries. In each query, you are given NNN and you should find the expected value of the tastiness of Chef's dish or determine that Chef cannot cook any dish.\nIf Chef can cook at least one dish, it can be proven that this expected value is a fraction in the form P/DP/DP/D, where PPP and DDD are coprime positive integers and DDD is coprime with 109+710^9+7109+7. You should compute P\xe2\x8b\x85D\xe2\x88\x921P \\cdot D^{-1}P\xe2\x8b\x85D\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 109+710^9+7109+7, where D\xe2\x88\x921D^{-1}D\xe2\x88\x921 denotes the multiplicative inverse of DDD modulo 109+710^9+7109+7.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers QQQ and KKK.\nEach of the next QQQ lines contains a single integer NNN describing a query.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each query, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 P\xe2\x8b\x85D\xe2\x88\x921P \\cdot D^{-1}P\xe2\x8b\x85D\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 109+710^9+7109+7, or 000 if Chef cannot cook any dish.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q,N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051 \\le Q, N \\le 2 \\cdot 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4Q,N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41052 \\le K \\le 10^52\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points):\n\nK=2K = 2K=2\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le N \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n\nSubtask #2 (15 points): K=2K = 2K=2\nSubtask #3 (75 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3 2\n1\n2\n40\n1\n166666669\nExplanation:\nIn the first query, it is impossible to cook a dish with two ingredients if N=1N = 1N=1.\nIn the second query, Chef can cook two dishes: (1,2)(1, 2)(1,2) and (2,1)(2, 1)(2,1). The tastiness of each of these dishes is 111, so the expected value of tastiness is 111."
