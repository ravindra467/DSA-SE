b'Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.\nGiven a set S of first N non-negative integers i.e. S = {0, 1, 2, ..., N}. Find number of ways of choosing a K size subset of S with the property that the XOR-sum of all chosen integers has exactly B set bits in its binary representation (i.e. the bits that are equal to 1). Since the answer can be large, output it modulo (109 + 7). Please refer to notes section for formal definition of XOR-sum.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, K and B.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 5\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 7\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 B \xe2\x89\xa4 30\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n2 2 0\n2 2 1\n2 2 20\n2\n1\nExplanation:\nExample case 1. There is no way to choose a subset of 2 integers from {0, 1, 2} such that the XOR-sum contains 0 set bits.\nExample case 2. The two possible subsets in this case are {0, 1} and {0, 2}. In both cases the XOR-sum (1 and 2 respectively) contains exactly one set bit.\nExample case 3. The only possible subset is {1, 2}.'
