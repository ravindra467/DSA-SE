b"Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian.\n\nSereja has a rooted tree of N nodes with node 1 being the root node. He wants to find the number of ways of assigning an integer in the range [1, M] to each node, such that value of each node should be a multiple of it's parent node's value (for vertex #1 there is no parent so any number fit condition). As the answer could be large, report it modulo (109 + 7).\n\nInput\nThe first line of input contains an integer T \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. T tests follow.\nFirst line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M. Each of the next N-1 lines contains two integers (u, v) \xe2\x80\x94 a pair of vertices connected by an edge. \n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single integer corresponding to the answer in separate line.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 500\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 20000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 u, v \xe2\x89\xa4 N\nIt is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree (i.e., there won't be any cycles or self-loops).\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n3 2\n1 2\n1 3\n1 1005\n100\nExplanation:\nIn first test case there are five possible assigns of numbers: [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1], [1, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2]. \nIn second test case there are hundred possible assigns: [1], [2], [3], ..., [100]."
