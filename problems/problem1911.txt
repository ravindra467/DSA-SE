b'Problem\nYoung Luffy is on a quest to become the King Of The Pirates. For that to happen he has to choose two comrades who will help him accomplish this goal. He has a group of N battle-hardened pirates to choose from. All the N pirates can be represented as a hierarchy of rooted tree where pirate 1 is the boss of all pirates. You are also given the Battle power of all the pirates in form of an array. The Nakama power of a pirate is defined as the sum of all Nakama power of the people included in his subtree plus his own battle power.\nIn short the Nakama power of any leaf node pirate is equal to his battle power.\nThe attitude ratio between any two pirates is defined as the absolute difference between their Nakama power. Your task is to help Luffy choose two comrades from the list of N pirates such that the attitude ratio between them is minimum possible.\nInput:\n\nFirst line of input contains NNN the number of pirates.\nNext N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 lines of input contain 2 space-separated integers xxx, yyy, where pirate xxx and yyy have a bi-directional relation between them.\nNext line of input contains NNN space-separated integers such that B[i]B[i]B[i] is the Battle power of ithithith pirate.\n\nOutput:\nIt should contain a single integer denoting the minimum attitude ratio between any two pirates.\nConstraints\n\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41052 \\leq N \\leq 10^52\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4B[i]\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq B[i] \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4B[i]\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSubtasks\n\n10 points : The given tree is a Star graph\n10 points : The given tree is a Path graph\n80 points : Original Constraints\n\nSample Input:\n8\n1 4\n1 6\n6 2\n6 3\n2 5\n2 7\n2 8\n3 5 8 10 2 6 7 11\nSample Output:\n1\n### EXPLANATION:\n\nThe tree can be represented as:\n\nThe Nakama power of each pirates are\nNa[3]=B[3]=8Na[3] = B[3] = 8Na[3]=B[3]=8 It is a leaf node so its Nakama power is equal to its Battle power.\nNa[4]=B[4]=10Na[4] = B[4] = 10Na[4]=B[4]=10 It is a leaf node so its Nakama power is equal to its Battle power.\nNa[5]=B[5]=2Na[5] = B[5] = 2Na[5]=B[5]=2 It is a leaf node so its Nakama power is equal to its Battle power.\nNa[7]=B[7]=7Na[7] = B[7] = 7Na[7]=B[7]=7 It is a leaf node so its Nakama power is equal to its Battle power.\nNa[8]=B[8]=11Na[8] = B[8] = 11Na[8]=B[8]=11 It is a leaf node so its Nakama power is equal to its Battle power.\nNa[2]=B[2]+Na[5]+Na[7]+Na[8]=25Na[2] = B[2] + Na[5] + Na[7] + Na[8] = 25Na[2]=B[2]+Na[5]+Na[7]+Na[8]=25 It will be the sum of all nodes in its subtree as well its own battle power.\nNa[6]=B[6]+Na[2]+Na[3]+Na[5]+Na[7]+Na[8]=39Na[6] = B[6] + Na[2] + Na[3] + Na[5] + Na[7] + Na[8] = 39Na[6]=B[6]+Na[2]+Na[3]+Na[5]+Na[7]+Na[8]=39 It will be the sum of all nodes in its subtree as well its own battle power.\nNa[1]=B[1]+Na[2]+Na[3]+Na[4]+Na[5]+Na[7]+Na[8]=52Na[1] = B[1] + Na[2] + Na[3] + Na[4] + Na[5] + Na[7] + Na[8] = 52Na[1]=B[1]+Na[2]+Na[3]+Na[4]+Na[5]+Na[7]+Na[8]=52 It will be the sum of all nodes in its subtree as well its own battle power.\nAs you can see Node 4 and 8 have a minimum difference of 1.\nSo the output is 1.'
