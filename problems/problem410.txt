b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a string SSS containing only decimal digits (\'0\' through \'9\') and a number NNN. Your task is to insert an arbitrary number (including zero) of plus signs \'+\' into SSS in order to form a valid expression whose value is equal to NNN.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a string SSS, followed by a space and an integer NNN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one string \xe2\x80\x94 your solution, i.e. the expression obtained after inserting some plus signs into SSS. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one. It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists.\nConstraints\n\nT\xe2\x89\xa45T \\le 5T\xe2\x89\xa45\n1\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa41201 \\le |S| \\le 1201\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4120\nN<=int(S)N \\lt= int(S)N<=int(S). Notes: int(S)int(S)int(S) is the integer value of SSS, if we consider SSS as an integer.\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points): N<106N \\lt 10^6N<106\nSubtask #2 (80 points): original constraints\nExample Input\n4\n15112 28\n120012 33\n123 123\n15489001 10549\n\nExample Output\n15+11+2\n1+20+012\n123\n1548+9001\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: SSS is "15112" and N=28N=28N=28. We can put a plus sign before the third character and another plus sign before the last character of this string to form the expression 15+11+215+11+215+11+2, which is equal to 282828.'
