b"Problem\nRead problems statements in Hindi,\nMandarin chinese\n, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nDuring Eid, it's a tradition that each father gives his kids money which they can spend on entertainment.\nChef has NNN coins; let's denote the value of coin iii by viv_ivi\xe2\x80\x8b. Since today is Eid, Chef is going to give one coin to each of his two children. He wants the absolute value of the difference between the values of coins given to the two children to be as small as possible, so that he would be as fair as possible.\nHelp Chef by telling him the minimum possible difference between the values of the coins given to the two children. Of course, Chef cannot give the same coin to both children.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers v1,v2,\xe2\x80\xa6,vNv_1, v_2, \\dots, v_Nv1\xe2\x80\x8b,v2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,vN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum possible difference.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le T \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41052 \\le N \\le 10^52\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nthe sum of NNN in all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x851055 \\cdot 10^55\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4vi\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\le v_i \\le 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4vi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4106 for each valid iii\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): the sum of NNN in all test cases does not exceed 2,0002,0002,000\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n3\n1 4 2\n3\n1 3 31\n0\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: Chef gives the coin with value 111 to his first child and the coin with value 222 to the second child, so the answer is 2\xe2\x88\x921=12-1 = 12\xe2\x88\x921=1.\nExample case 2: Chef gives each of his children a coin with value 333, so the difference is 000."
