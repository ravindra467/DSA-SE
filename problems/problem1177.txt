b'Problem\nYou are given with a string SSS. The string contains NNN number of valid fragments. The fragment is a substring of a string. The fragment is called valid, if the string starts with the word "newyear", then goes on with 0 or more characters in-between, and eventually ends with the string "2021". Find such NNN valid fragments.\nThe two fragments are considered to be different, if they start or end at different positions in the string SSS, even if the fragments read the same. Note that different valid fragments may overlap.\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line and only line contains a string SSS. Containing only lowercase letters and numbers as characters.\n\n\nOutput:\n\nPrint a single line containing the integer NNN \xe2\x80\x93 the number of valid fragments.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\leq S \\leq 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa4103\n\n\nSample Input 1:\n   hellonewyearwelcome2021\n\nSample Output 1:\n    1\n\n\nSample Input 2:\n   newyearchef2021codenewyear2021\n\nSample Output 2:\n    3\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nSample case 1: There is only one valid fragment namely,  newyearwelcome2021 and one occurrence of newyear2021.\nSample case 2: There are three valid fragments, namely, newyearchef2021codenewyear2021 and two occurrences of newyear2021.'
