b'Problem\nThis problem is similar to the problem "INTREECTIVE2". The only difference between them is the number of queries allowed \xe2\x80\x94 in this problem, up to 21 queries can be made. In Div. 1 and Div. 2 this problem is worth 40 points and "INTREECTIVE2" is worth 60. In Div. 3 this problem is non-scorable.\nThis is an interactive task\nYou are given a tree consisting of NNN nodes, numbered from 111 to NNN. Chef selected an arbitrary node and marked it.\nChef gave you a judge to play with, using which you can ask queries about the given tree.\nIn each query, you give the judge a non-empty set SSS of nodes. The judge returns 111 if there exists uuu and vvv (not necessarily distinct) such that u,v\xe2\x88\x88Su,v \\in Su,v\xe2\x88\x88S and the marked node lies on the shortest path from uuu to vvv, or 000 otherwise.\nYou have to find the marked node.\nFor each test case, you can use at most 21 queries.\nInteraction\n\n\nBegin the interaction by reading a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of interaction for TTT test cases follows.\n\n\nFor each test case, first read a single integer NNN, denoting the number of nodes in the tree.\n\n\nN\xe2\x88\x921N - 1N\xe2\x88\x921 lines follow. The ithi^{th}ith of these lines contains two space-separated integers uiu_iui\xe2\x80\x8b and viv_ivi\xe2\x80\x8b, denoting an edge between the nodes uiu_iui\xe2\x80\x8b and viv_ivi\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.\n\n\nNow you may begin asking queries. To ask a query about a set SSS of kkk nodes v1,v2,\xe2\x80\xa6,vkv_{1},v_{2},\xe2\x80\xa6,v_{k}v1\xe2\x80\x8b,v2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,vk\xe2\x80\x8b (1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4N,1\xe2\x89\xa4vi\xe2\x89\xa4N,1 \\le k \\le N, 1 \\le v_{i} \\le N,1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4N,1\xe2\x89\xa4vi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4N, all viv_{i}vi\xe2\x80\x8b are distinct), output:\n? kkk v1v_{1}v1\xe2\x80\x8b v2v_{2}v2\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\xa6\\ldots\xe2\x80\xa6 vkv_{k}vk\xe2\x80\x8b\n\n\nYou will then receive an integer xxx. xxx is 111 if there exists uuu and vvv(not necessarily distinct) such that  u,v\xe2\x88\x88Su,v \\in Su,v\xe2\x88\x88S and the marked node lies on the path from uuu to vvv, or 000 otherwise.\n\n\nWhen you have found the marked node(say vvv), print the answer in the following format:\n! vvv\n\n\nOutputting the answer doesn\'t count towards the limit of 212121 queries.\n\n\nIf at any time you make an invalid query or exceed the query limit, the interaction is terminated and you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.\n\n\nIf you receive a Judge Error verdict, that means your program actually has one of many possible errors: an Idleness Limit Exceeded error (it is waiting for input that does not exist), a Runtime error, you asked an invalid query, or possibly some other error.\n\n\nDon\'t forget to flush the output after printing each line!\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\le T \\le 10001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\le N \\le 10001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000\nThe input graph is a tree\nSum of NNN does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x851045 \\cdot 10^45\xe2\x8b\x85104 over all test cases\nAt most 212121 queries can be made.\n\nSample Interaction\nGrader                You\n2\n2\n1 2\n                      ? 1 1\n0\n                      ! 2\n4\n1 2\n1 4\n1 3\n                      ? 3 1 2 3\n1\n                      ? 1 3\n1\n                      ! 3\n\nExplanation\n\n\nTest case 111: After the 1st1^{st}1st query, we know that node 111 hasn\'t been marked. So, we are left with only one possibility \xe2\x80\x94 node 222.\n\n\nTest case 222: Chef marked the node 3.\n\n\nNote: The above queries are just to demonstrate the interaction. They may or may not be sufficient to deduce the final answer.'
