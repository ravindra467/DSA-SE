b'Problem\n\nChefu is studying English language and is obsessed with palindrome strings. Chefu also a good student and wants to earn the Prefecto, a badge of honer given to the most brillant mind of the class.\n\n\nSince every one in the class want to earn the badge, teacher devices a task. She would give a number of strings(may or may not be palindrome) and ask the student to find the longest palindrome in that string from the begining.Help Chefu to earn the PrefctoPrefctoPrefcto badge.\n\nInput:\n\nFirst-line will contain TTT, the number of test cases. Then the test case follows. \n Each test case contains a single input SSS (Given String)\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, print the length of the longest palindrome from the beginning \nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq T \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\leq |S| \\leq 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4103\n\nSample Input:\n4\nabbaxty\nabcd\naaaaa\nabxbatvaaaaaaaa\n\nSample Output:\n4\n1\n5\n5\n\nExplanation\nIn case 1:Longest palindrome  from beginning string=abba, length=4\nIn case 2:Longest palindrome  from beginning string=a, length=1\n'
