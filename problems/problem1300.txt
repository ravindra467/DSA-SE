b"Problem\nRuman loves creating software. He has recently created a new open source project which is gaining popularity exponentially. Many skilled developers all across the globe want to contribute to his project. Pull resuests are just flowing in every day. There are a lot of options for Ruman, but he doesn't have time to address each one of them. His project has received pull requests in the past NNN days consecutively, and the sequence A1,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_{1}, \\dots, A_{N}A1\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b describes the number of requests received each day. Now, he wants to check as many requests as possible but not exceeding KKK, because there's a limit to everything. And, he wants to pick requests only from a contiguous subsequence of days. If there are multiple such contiguous subsequences for which the pull requests are maximum possible (not exceeding KKK), then he'll prefer the range of days which starts the earliest.\nInput:\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space separated integers NNN and KKK.\nThe second line contains NNN space separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_{1}, A_{2}, \\dots, A_{N}A1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case print a single line containing three space separated integers LLL, RRR and \xe2\x88\x91i=LRAi\\sum\\limits_{i = L}^{R}{A_{i}}i=L\xe2\x88\x91R\xe2\x80\x8bAi\xe2\x80\x8b.\nIf it is not possible to find such a contiguous segment, print \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 in a single line.\nConstraints:\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^{5}1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq A_{i} \\leq 10^{9}1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109, for each valid iii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa410141 \\leq K \\leq 10^{14}1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41014\nSum of NNN over all test cases doesn't exceed 10610^{6}106\n\nSubtasks:\n\n\n10 points:\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq N \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa410111 \\leq K \\leq 10^{11}1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41011\nSum of NNN over all test cases doesn't exceed 100100100\n\n\n30 points:\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\leq N \\leq 10^{3}1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa410121 \\leq K \\leq 10^{12}1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41012\nSum of NNN over all test cases doesn't exceed 10310^{3}103\n\n\n60 points: original constraints\n\n\nSample Input:\n3\r\n3 2\r\n1 1 1\r\n3 12\r\n1 7 2\r\n3 5\r\n6 6 6\n\nSample Output:\n1 2 2\r\n1 3 10\r\n-1\n"
