b"Problem\nAs we all know that there is a chance of war between India and Pakistan. Suppose in the future war begins and army chief has to distribute packets of explosives and each packet has a different number of explosives and every soldier must allocate at least one packet. Chief makes many groups. In each group, there are different numbers of soldiers. Chief has NNN number of packets, Chief has to allocate packets in a group who have MMM number of soldiers. There are many ways to do so. But in each way one of the soldiers will get the maximum number of explosives. Out of all these ways chief want to find the particular way in which the maximum number of explosives allocated to a soldier is minimum of those in all other permutations or ways and chief want to find that minimum number. Please help the chief to do so.\nNote: Return \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 if a valid assignment is not possible, and allotment should be in contiguous order (see the explanation for better understanding).\nInput:\n-The first line contains '$T$' denoting the number of test cases. Then follows the description of T test cases:\r\n-Each case begins with a single positive integer $N$ denoting the number of packets.\r\n-The second line contains $N$ space-separated positive integers denoting the number of explosives in each packet.\r\n-The third line contains another integer $M$, denoting the number of the soldier in each group.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the minimum number of explosives each soldier has to read for the corresponding test case.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq T \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42001 \\leq N \\leq 2001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4200\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A[i]\xe2\x89\xa426000001 \\leq A[i] \\leq 26000001\xe2\x89\xa4A[i]\xe2\x89\xa42600000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4351 \\leq M \\leq 351\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa435\n\nSample Input:\n2\r\n4\r\n10 20 30 40\r\n3\r\n3\r\n15 17 20\r\n2\n\nSample Output:\n40\r\n32\n\nExplaination:\nAllocation can be done in following ways:\r\n${10 },{20},{30,40}$      Maximum explosives = $70$\r\n${10},{20,30},{40}$       Maximum explosives = $50$ \r\n${10,20},{30},{40}$       Maximum explosives = $40$\r\n\r\nTherefore, the minimum of these cases is $40$, which is selected as the output.\n"
