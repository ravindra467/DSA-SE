b'Problem\nCobb wants to assess if Ariadne is good enough to be recruited into team Inception. He asks her to design a maze of tunnels so that any person that enters the maze from any of the entry points will take a minimum of k units of time to exit from any of the exit points.\nAriadne has created some mazes in the form of a connected undirected graph where each node of the graph represents a  point where two or more tunnels are connected to one another and the edges between the nodes represent the units of time taken to travel between those nodes.\nHowever, Ariadne cannot figure out a way to find what will be the minimum time taken by a person to enter and come out of the maze given that he can only enter and exit the maze from specific entry and exit nodes.\nHelp Ariadne evaluate if her maze passes Cobb\'s criteria.\nInput:\n\nThe first line of input contains 4 integers - NNN which represents the number of nodes in the graph, KKK which represents the minimum time a person will have to spend in the maze, EEE, the number of edges in the graph, AAA the number of entry and exit points in the graph.\nThe second line of the input contains AAA space-separated integers that represent the nodes of the graph that can be used as an entry and exit points.\nnext EEE lines contain 3 space-separated integers UUU, VVV and TTT representing that a tunnel runs from UUU to VVV and one takes TTT time to cross it. Conversely, it should take the same time to go from VVV to UUU.\n\nNote: Each of the AAA points can behave as both entry and exit. However, if a person chooses Ai as his entry point he cannot exit the maze from Ai.\nOutput:\nif the minimum time taken by a person to go in and come out of the maze is more than or equal to KKK then print in a single line "PASS" else print "FAIL".\nConstraints\n\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N,U,V\xe2\x89\xa410002 \\leq N,U,V \\leq 10002\xe2\x89\xa4N,U,V\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A\xe2\x89\xa41021 \\leq A \\leq 10^21\xe2\x89\xa4A\xe2\x89\xa4102\n1\xe2\x89\xa4E\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\leq E \\leq 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4E\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4W\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq W \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4W\xe2\x89\xa4100\n\nSample Input:\n    4 6 3 3\r\n    1 3 4\r\n    1 2 4\r\n    2 3 3\r\n    2 4 4\n\nSample Output:\n    PASS\n'
