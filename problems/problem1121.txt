b'Problem\nYou are given a matrix of characters. The matrix has\xc2\xa0N\xc2\xa0rows and\xc2\xa0M\xc2\xa0columns. Given a string\xc2\xa0s, you have to tell if it is possible to generate that string from given matrix.\nRules for generating string from matrix are:\n\nYou have to pick first character of string from row\xc2\xa01, second character from row\xc2\xa02\xc2\xa0and so on. The\xc2\xa0(N+1)th\xc2\xa0character of string is to be picked from row\xc2\xa01, that is, you can traverse the rows in a cyclic manner (row\xc2\xa01\xc2\xa0comes after row\xc2\xa0N).\nIf an occurrence of a character is picked from a row, you cannot pick the same occurrence again from that row.\n\nYou have to print\xc2\xa0Yes\xc2\xa0if given string can be generated from matrix using the given rules, else print\xc2\xa0No.\nInput Format:\nFirst line consists of\xc2\xa0T, denoting the number of test cases.\nEach test case consists of:\nFirst line consists of two integers\xc2\xa0N\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0M, denoting the matrix dimensions.\nFollowing\xc2\xa0N\xc2\xa0lines consist of\xc2\xa0M\xc2\xa0characters each.\nThe last line consists of a string\xc2\xa0s.\nOutput Format:\nFor each test case, print "Yes" if the string can be generated else print "No". Answer for each test case should come in a new line.\nInput Constraints:\n 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 5\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, M \xe2\x89\xa4500\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 |s| \xe2\x89\xa4 N\xe2\x88\x97M\nThe matrix consists of lowercase English characters.\nString\xc2\xa0s\xc2\xa0consists of lowercase English characters.\n Example \n Input \n1\n3 3\naba\nxyz\nbdr\naxbaydb\nOutput\nYes\n'
