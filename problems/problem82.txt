b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nA manufacturing project consists of exactly KKK tasks. The board overviewing the project wants to hire KKK teams of workers \xe2\x80\x94 one for each task. All teams begin working simultaneously.\nObviously, there must be at least one person in each team. For a team of AAA workers, it takes exactly AAA days to complete the task they are hired for. Each team acts independently, unaware of the status of other teams (whether they have completed their tasks or not), and submits their result for approval on the AAA-th day.\nHowever, the board approves the project only if all KKK teams complete their tasks on the same day \xe2\x80\x94 it rejects everything submitted on any other day. The day after a team finds out that its result was rejected, it resumes work on the same task afresh. Therefore, as long as a team of AAA workers keeps getting rejected, it submits a new result of their task for approval on the AAA-th, 2A2A2A-th, 3A3A3A-th day etc.\nThe board wants to hire workers in such a way that it takes exactly XXX days to complete the project. Find the smallest number of workers it needs to hire.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers KKK and XXX.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the smallest required number of workers.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4401 \\le T \\le 401\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa440\n2\xe2\x89\xa4K,X\xe2\x89\xa41062 \\le K, X \\le 10^62\xe2\x89\xa4K,X\xe2\x89\xa4106\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n2 3\n2 64\n5\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: We can hire a team of 333 workers for task 111 and 111 worker for task 222. The one-man team working on task 222 completes it and submits the result for approval on each day, but it is rejected on the first and second day. On the third day, the team working on task 111 also completes their task, so the project gets approved after exactly 333 days.\nExample case 2: We can hire a team of 333 workers for task 111 and a team of 222 workers for task 222.'
