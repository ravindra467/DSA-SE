b'Problem\nIn Chefland, there are NNN houses numbered from 111 to NNN, ithi^{th}ith house has a defence system having strength AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b.\nChef suspects a bomb drop on one of the houses very soon. A bomb with attack strength XXX can destroy the ithi^{th}ith house, if the defence system of the ithi^{th}ith house AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b, is strictly less than XXX.\nAlso, when the ithi^{th}ith house is destroyed due to the bomb, all houses with indices jjj such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4j<i1 \\leq j \\lt i1\xe2\x89\xa4j<i get destroyed as well irrespective of their defence system.\nGiven one bomb with attack strength XXX, find the maximum number of houses that can get destroyed.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line will contain TTT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nFirst line of each test case contains 222 integers N,XN , XN,X.\nSecond line of test case contains NNN space separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2,\\ldots ,A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output in a single line the maximum number of houses that can get destroyed if the bomb can hit any house.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq T \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq X \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\nSum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 10510^5105\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n8 6\n4 1 6 1 6 5 6 8\n2 1\n3 5\n6\n0\n\nExplanation:\nTest Case 111: The bomb can only destroy houses 1,2,4,1, 2, 4,1,2,4, and 666.\n\nIf it hits house 111, only house 111 is destroyed.\nIf it hits house 222, houses 111 and 222 are destroyed.\nIf it hits house 444, houses 1,2,31, 2, 31,2,3 and 444 are destroyed.\nIf it hits house 666, houses 1,2,3,4,5,1, 2, 3, 4, 5,1,2,3,4,5, and 666 are destroyed.\n\nThe maximum number of destroyed houses is 666.\nTest Case 222: The  bomb cannot destroy any of the houses as the defence system of each house is not lesser than attack power of bomb. Thus, the total number of destroyed houses is 000.'
