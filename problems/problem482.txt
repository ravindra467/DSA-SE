b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Mandarin, Bengali, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nThe nation of Islandia can be represented as an N\xc3\x97NN \\times NN\xc3\x97N grid. Let (i,j)(i, j)(i,j) denote the square at the iii-th row from the top and the jjj-th column from the left. A cell (i,j)(i, j)(i,j) is labelled 111 if it is land and 000 if it is water. Any two cells of the grid which share a side, and are both land are said to belong to the same island.\nIslandia holds two contests a year, the first at (xa,ya)(x_a, y_a)(xa\xe2\x80\x8b,ya\xe2\x80\x8b) and the second at (xb,yb)(x_b, y_b)(xb\xe2\x80\x8b,yb\xe2\x80\x8b). Ashish will need to travel from cell (xa,ya)(x_a, y_a)(xa\xe2\x80\x8b,ya\xe2\x80\x8b) to (xb,yb)(x_b, y_b)(xb\xe2\x80\x8b,yb\xe2\x80\x8b). To do so, he can perform a sequence of zero or more moves. In each move if he is at (xi,yi)(x_i, y_i)(xi\xe2\x80\x8b,yi\xe2\x80\x8b), he can perform one of two actions:\n\nType 1: Move from (xi,yi)(x_i, y_i)(xi\xe2\x80\x8b,yi\xe2\x80\x8b) to some land cell (xj,yj)(x_j, y_j)(xj\xe2\x80\x8b,yj\xe2\x80\x8b) that lies on a different island at a cost of \xe2\x88\xa3xi\xe2\x88\x92xj\xe2\x88\xa3+\xe2\x88\xa3yi\xe2\x88\x92yj\xe2\x88\xa3| x_i - x_j | + | y_i - y_j |\xe2\x88\xa3xi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\x92xj\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\xa3+\xe2\x88\xa3yi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\x92yj\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\xa3\nType 2: Move from (xi,yi)(x_i, y_i)(xi\xe2\x80\x8b,yi\xe2\x80\x8b) to some land cell (xj,yj)(x_j, y_j)(xj\xe2\x80\x8b,yj\xe2\x80\x8b) that lies on the same island at a cost of 000.\n\nLet the beauty of a sequence of moves be the number of moves of type 111 while traveling from (xa,ya)(x_a, y_a)(xa\xe2\x80\x8b,ya\xe2\x80\x8b) to (xb,yb)(x_b, y_b)(xb\xe2\x80\x8b,yb\xe2\x80\x8b). We define the simple cost as the minimum cost of a sequence with beauty\xe2\x89\xa41\\mathrm{beauty} \\leq 1beauty\xe2\x89\xa41.\nAshish wants to figure out the maximum beauty possible to go from (xa,ya)(x_a,y_a)(xa\xe2\x80\x8b,ya\xe2\x80\x8b) to (xb,yb)(x_b, y_b)(xb\xe2\x80\x8b,yb\xe2\x80\x8b) without exceeding the simple cost. However, Ashish only knows (xa,ya)(x_a, y_a)(xa\xe2\x80\x8b,ya\xe2\x80\x8b). Find the answer for every possible land cell (xb,yb)(x_b, y_b)(xb\xe2\x80\x8b,yb\xe2\x80\x8b).\nNote that we DO NOT need to minimize the cost of the trip, only maximize the beauty without exceeding the simple cost.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer TTT, the number of test cases. Then TTT test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer NNN.\nThe following NNN lines each contains a string S=s1s2\xe2\x80\xa6sNS=s_1 s_2 \\ldots s_NS=s1\xe2\x80\x8bs2\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\xa6sN\xe2\x80\x8b. The string on the iii-th line represents the iii-th row of the grid, where sjs_{j}sj\xe2\x80\x8b is 111 if the cell (i,j)(i, j)(i,j) is land, and 000 if it is water.\nThe last line of each test case contains two integers xax_{a}xa\xe2\x80\x8b and yay_{a}ya\xe2\x80\x8b where (xa,ya)(x_a, y_a)(xa\xe2\x80\x8b,ya\xe2\x80\x8b) represents the cell where the first contest will be held. It is guaranteed that this cell will be a land cell.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print NNN lines, each containing the NNN space-separated integers. The jjj-th value of the iii-th line represents the maximum beauty possible on a journey from (xa,ya)(x_a, y_a)(xa\xe2\x80\x8b,ya\xe2\x80\x8b) to (i,j)(i, j)(i,j) satisfying the mentioned conditions, if the cell (i,j)(i, j)(i,j) is land. If (i,j)(i, j)(i,j) is a water cell or belongs to the same island as (xa,ya)(x_a, y_a)(xa\xe2\x80\x8b,ya\xe2\x80\x8b), the value to be printed is 0.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4201 \\leq T \\leq 201\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa420\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42001 \\leq N \\leq 2001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4200\n1\xe2\x89\xa4xa,ya\xe2\x89\xa4N1\\le x_a, y_a\\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4xa\xe2\x80\x8b,ya\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4N\nThe sum of N2N^2N2 over all cases does not exceed 4\xe2\x8b\x851044\\cdot 10^44\xe2\x8b\x85104\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (15 points):\n\nN\xe2\x89\xa450N \\leq 50N\xe2\x89\xa450\nThe sum of N2N^2N2 over all cases does not exceed 250025002500\n\nSubtask #2 (35 points):\n\nN\xe2\x89\xa4100N \\leq 100N\xe2\x89\xa4100\nThe sum of N2N^2N2 over all cases does not exceed 10410^4104\n\nSubtask #3 (50 points): Original constraints\nSample Input 1\n2\n2\n00\n01\n2 2\n5\n00001\n10010\n00001\n00000\n01010\n2 4\n```### Sample Output 1\n\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0 0 0 1\n1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 1 0\n### Sample Input 2\n\n2\n3\n011\n010\n001\n2 2\n9\n110000011\n001100001\n100100111\n011000010\n000110011\n000010100\n000011111\n111101001\n101110110\n3 1\n### Sample Output 2\n\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n0 0 1\n1 1 0 0 0 0 0 3 3\n0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 3\n0 0 0 1 0 0 3 3 3\n0 1 1 0 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 2 2 0 0 3 3\n0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2\n1 1 1 1 0 2 0 0 2\n1 0 1 1 1 0 6 6 0\n### Sample Input 3\n\n2\n7\n1011101\n0000000\n0000000\n0000000\n0000000\n0000000\n0000000\n1 1\n9\n111111101\n100000000\n100000000\n100000000\n100000000\n100000000\n100000000\n100000000\n111111101\n9 9\n### Sample Output 3\n\n0 0 1 1 1 0 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 4\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n### Explanation\n\n**Sample 1, test case 2:**\n\nThe simple cost from $(2, 4)$ to $(5, 2)$ is $| 2 - 5 | + | 4 - 2 | = 3 + 2 = 5$. We can achieve a beauty of $2$ without exceeding the simple cost in the following manner:\n\n- Perform a move of type $1$ from $(2, 4)$ to $(5, 4)$ at a cost of $3$.\n- Perform a move of type $1$ from $(5, 4)$ to $(5, 2)$ at a cost of $2$.\n\n**Sample 3, test case 1:**\n\nThe simple cost from $(1, 1)$ to $(1, 7)$ is $| 1 - 1 | + | 1 - 7 | = 0 + 6 = 6$. However we can achieve a beauty of $2$ without exceeding the simple cost in the following manner:\n\n- Perform a move of type $1$ from $(1, 1)$ to $(1, 3)$ at a cost of $2$.\n- Perform a move of type $2$ from $(1, 3)$ to $(1, 5)$ at a cost of $0$.\n- Perform a move of type $1$ from $(1, 5)$ to $(1, 7)$ at a cost of $2$.\n\nNote that the cost of some sequence with beauty $> 1$ might be lower than the simple cost.\n\n**Sample 3, test case 2:**\n\nIn the second case of third sample, the simple cost from $(9, 9)$ to $(1, 9)$ is $| 9 - 1 | + | 9 - 9 | = 8 + 0 = 8$. However we can achieve a beauty of $4$ without exceeding the simple cost in the following manner:\n\n- Perform a move of type $1$ from $(9, 9)$ to $(9, 7)$ at a cost of $2$.\n- Perform a move of type $2$ from $(9, 7)$ to $(1, 7)$ at a cost of $0$.\n- Perform a move of type $1$ from $(1, 7)$ to $(1, 9)$ at a cost of $2$.\n- Perform a move of type $1$ from $(1, 9)$ to $(1, 7)$ at a cost of $2$.\n- Perform a move of type $1$ from $(1, 7)$ to $(1, 9)$ at a cost of $2$.\n\nAlso note that in the same sample the answer for $(1, 7)$ will be $1$, not $3$ as the simple cost from $(9, 9)$ to $(1, 7)$ is $2$. This can be achieved by performing a move of type $1$ from $(9, 9)$ to $(9, 7)$ at cost of $2$ and then a move of type $2$ from $(9, 7)$ to $(1, 7)$ at a cost of $0$.\n'
