b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Russian, Mandarin Chinese, Bengali, and Vietnamese as well.\nThere are NNN people, numbered from 111 to NNN. They go to a cinema hall. Each of them buys a ticket, which has a number written on it. The number on the ticket of the ithi^{th}ith person is AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b.\nThere are infinite seats in the cinema hall. The seats are numbered sequentially starting from 111. All the NNN people stand in a queue to get their respective seats. Person 111 stands at the front of the queue, Person 222 stands in the second position of the queue, so on up to Person NNN who stands at the rear of the queue. They were given seats in this manner:\nLet the number on the ticket of the person currently standing in front of the queue be XXX. If the XthX^{th}Xth seat is empty, the person gets out of the queue and takes the XthX^{th}Xth seat. Otherwise the person goes to the rear of the queue, and the number on his ticket is incremented by one - that is, it becomes X+1X+1X+1.\nPrint the seat number occupied by each of the NNN people.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nThe second line of each testcase line contains NNN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\dots , A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print a single line containing NNN space-separated integers, where the ithi^{th}ith integer denotes the seat number finally occupied by the Person iii.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\leq T \\leq 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq A_i \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4N\nThe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x851055 \\cdot 10^55\xe2\x8b\x85105.\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4\n5\n1 2 3 2 4\n4\n4 1 3 2\n3\n1 1 1\n5\n2 5 1 5 21 2 3 5 4\n4 1 3 2\n1 2 3\n2 5 1 6 3 \n\nExplanation:\nTest case 111:\n\nFirst, the first, second, third, and fifth person get the seats numbered 111, 222, 333, and 444 respectively because when they come to the front of the queue the corresponding seats are empty. The fourth person does not get the seat numbered 222, because when he comes to the front of the queue, the seat is already occupied by the second person. Hence he goes to the rear of the queue and the number on the ticket of the fourth person is incremented by one and becomes 333.\nThe fourth person does not get the seat numbered 333 because it is already occupied by the third person. Hence the number on the ticket of the fourth person is incremented by one and becomes 444.\nAgain, the fourth person does not get the seat numbered 444 because it is occupied by the fifth person. Hence the number on the ticket of the fourth person is incremented by one and becomes 555.\nFinally the fourth person gets the seat numbered 555.\n\nTest case 333:\n\n\nThe first person gets the seat numbered 111. The second and third people do not get the seat numbered 111 because when they come to the front of the queue, the seat is already occupied by the first person. Hence the number on the tickets of both is incremented by one and becomes 222.\n\n\nThen, the second person gets the seat numbered 222. The third person does not get the seat numbered 222 because when he comes to the front of the queue, it is already occupied by the second person. Hence the number on the ticket of the third person is increased to 333.\n\n\nFinally, the third person gets the seat numbered 333.\n\n'
