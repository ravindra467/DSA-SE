b'Problem\nOmy and Ish were learning the pattern printing. In order to learn they give themselves a task. In this task they are given a string and they have to form a pyramid with the pattern as follows:\r\nRowNumber are one based indexed.\n\n\nIf (RowNumber % 3 == 0) then string is written in left to right while in other cases it is written in right to left order.\n\n\nif the string end it will be started again and end of the pyramid need not to be the end of string.\n\n\nFor eg: string is \xe2\x80\x9cCODINGCODINGCODING\xe2\x80\x9d and height of pyramid is \xe2\x80\x9c555\xe2\x80\x9d\n          C\r\n         D O\r\n        I N G\r\n       I D O C\r\n      D O C G N\n\nOmi will be asked QQQ queries and he has to tell the frequency of a character  C in that particular row RRR of pyramid.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain NNN, height of pyramid.\nNext line contain a string consists only of Uppercase English Alphabets, length not exceed 10610^6106\nThird line contain a single integer QQQ, the number of queries to be asked.\nEach query contain two space separated integers, RRR and CCC, where RRR is the row number and CCC is the character.\n\nOutput:\n\nFor each query, output in a single line the frequency of the alphabet in the given row.\n\nConstraints:\n\n111 \xe2\x89\xa4\\leq\xe2\x89\xa4 NNN \xe2\x89\xa4\\leq\xe2\x89\xa4 101010^181818\n111 \xe2\x89\xa4\\leq\xe2\x89\xa4 QQQ \xe2\x89\xa4\\leq\xe2\x89\xa4 500005000050000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq R \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4N\nA\xe2\x89\xa4C\xe2\x89\xa4ZA \\leq C \\leq ZA\xe2\x89\xa4C\xe2\x89\xa4Z\n\nSample Input:\n 5\r\n CODING\r\n 2\r\n 1 C\r\n 2 D\n\nSample Output:\n 1\r\n 1\n'
