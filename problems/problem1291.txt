b'Problem\nEgor came to the Olympiad in Informatics. But the tasks turned out to be too difficult, so Egor chose to sleep instead of solving problems. But as we all know, everyone is very happy when someone is the first who solved the problem.\nThere are NNN problems in the contest. The iii-th of them was solved at minute LiL_iLi\xe2\x80\x8b for the first time. This task will stop increasing the joy of everyone around at the minute Ri+1R_i + 1Ri\xe2\x80\x8b+1 (that is, RiR_iRi\xe2\x80\x8b is the last minute when the task increases the joy). In other words, the iii-th task increases the joyfulness for everyone by 111 unit from the minute LiL_iLi\xe2\x80\x8b to the minute RiR_iRi\xe2\x80\x8b.\nIn the anime that Egor watched recently, there are various techniques that can make a person fall asleep. Egor knows techniques that will allow him to sleep for any minutes between AAA and BBB minutes, i.e. Egor can sleep for AAA minutes, A+1A + 1A+1 minutes, ..., BBB minutes. Egor can also combine techniques, i.e. he can choose techniques with different duration and then sleep the total time of all techniques.\nEgor wants to combine techniques to wake up in the most joyful moment possible. Your task is to find the maximum joy in which Egor can wake up.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of the input contains the number TTT - the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains integers NNN, AAA, and BBB - the number of tasks and A,BA, BA,B values described in the statement.\nThe next NNN lines give you a description of the problems. Each line contains two numbers Li,RiL_i, R_iLi\xe2\x80\x8b,Ri\xe2\x80\x8b - a segment of joy for every task.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print the maximum level of joy at which Egor can wake up.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851051 \\leq T \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851051 \\le N \\le 3 \\cdot 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A\xe2\x89\xa4B\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4A\xe2\x89\xa4B\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Li\xe2\x89\xa4Ri\xe2\x89\xa410181 \\leq L_i \\leq R_i \\leq 10^{18}1\xe2\x89\xa4Li\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4Ri\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa41018\nSum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x851053 \\cdot 10^53\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\n\nSubtasks\n\n\nSubtask 111 (30 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4Li\xe2\x89\xa4Ri\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq L_i \\leq R_i \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Li\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4Ri\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\nSubtask 222 (10 points): A=1A = 1A=1\nSubtask 333 (60 points): Original constraints\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n3 1 5\n1 5\n3 9\n6 9\n3 7 54\n54 228\n228 1337\n69 213\n3 1 9\n100 100\n99 99\n98 98\n2\n2\n0\n\nExplanation:\n\nTest case 111: We can use techniques 111 and 222 to wake up at minute 1+2=31 + 2 = 31+2=3. At that time, there are 222 tasks that give Egor joy: task 111 (which gives joy during the range [1,5][1, 5][1,5]), and task 222 (which gives joy during the range [3,9][3, 9][3,9]). It can be proven that Egor cannot acquire joy from all 333 tasks at the same time, so 222 is the maximum joyfulness Egor can wake up to.\nTest case 222: We can use techniques 151515, 222222, and 323232 to wake up at minute 15+22+32=6915 + 22 + 32 = 6915+22+32=69. At that time. there are 222 tasks that give Egor joy: task 111 and task 333.\nTest case 333: The maximum minute we can wake up to is 1+2+\xe2\x8b\xaf+9=451 + 2 + \\dots + 9 = 451+2+\xe2\x8b\xaf+9=45, which means we cannot acquire joy from any task.\n'
