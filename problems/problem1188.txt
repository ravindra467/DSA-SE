b"Problem\n\nMalicious Music\nProblem Definition :\nDhruvi is a musician who writes her music as a sequence of numbers and lowercase letters, where the letters represent the frequencies of the tones, and each letter is preceded by a positive integer Ai which is the amplitude of that tone. For example a song could be 9 s 5 a 7 q 6 e 5 b 1 a. She recently found out that her friend Shivanee has added a few malicious sequences, which produce an unpleasant noise when played together, in between Dhruvi's sequence to sabotage her work. Luckily Dhruvi was able to deduce the base sequence of Shivanee's tones and plans to remove them from her music. All integral multiples of the base sequence must also be removed.\n\n\nFor example if 1 a 3 b is the base sequence to be removed then 4 a 12 b must also be removed. If N is the length of the entire music sequence and M is the length of Shivanee's malicious sequence, find the number of such sequences to be removed.\n\nNote: Overlapping solutions to be considered\n\nConstraints :\n\n0 < T <= 100\n0 < N <= 103\n0 < M <= N\n1 <= Ai <= 200\n\nInput :\n\nFirst line contains T, the number of testcases.\nThe first line of each testcase line contains two  integers, N and M\nThe second line contains N space seperated tones, which is the entire musical sequence\nThe third line contains  M space seperated tones, which is the base sequence to be removed\n\nOutput :\n\nFor each testcase output a single integer, the number of removals necessary\n\nExample :\nInput:\n2\n7 3\n3 a 8 b 2 c 6 m 2 d 11 e 6 f\n4 b 1 c 3 m\n9 2\n1 f 2 a 9 c 10 q 6 m 12 d 3 f 6 a 3 m\n1 f 2 a\n\nOutput:\n1\n2\nExplanation\nFor the first test case, we only have to remove the sequence 8 b 2 c 6 m, which is 2 times 4 b 1 c 3 m.\nIn the second testcase we must remove 1 f 2 a and 3 f 6 a ( 1 f 2 a multiplied by 3 ). So the number of removals necessary is 2."
