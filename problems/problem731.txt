b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nYou are given a string SSS with length NNN. Determine if it is possible to find two non-empty strings AAA and BBB which satisfy the following conditions:\n\nA+B=SA + B = SA+B=S, where +++ denotes string concatenation\nBBB is a substring of AAA\n\nNote: BBB is a substring of AAA if BBB can be obtained from AAA by deleting several (possibly zero) characters from the beginning and several (possibly zero) characters from the end. For example, "ab" is a substring of "cabd", but "ad" is not.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nThe second line contains a single string SSS.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to find strings AAA and BBB satisfying the given conditions or "NO" otherwise (without quotes).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\le T \\le 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4104\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41052 \\le N \\le 10^52\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3=N|S| = N\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3=N\nSSS contains only lowercase English letters\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 10610^6106\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput5\n6\ncabdab\n21\nyourcrushlovesyouback\n16\nwubbalubbadubdub\n5\nsplit\n7\nsplititYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: We can choose "cabd" as AAA and "ab" as BBB. We can see that A+B=SA + B = SA+B=S and BBB is a substring of AAA.\nExample case 2: It is impossible to find two strings which satisfy the constraints. For example, when AAA is "yourcrushlovesyou" and BBB is "back", then A+B=SA + B = SA+B=S, but BBB is not a substring of AAA.\nExample case 3: We can choose "wubbalubbadub" as AAA and "dub" as BBB.'
