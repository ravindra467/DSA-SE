b'Problem\n\nChef Po had recently started home delivery service for pizzas. Po has only a single delivery boy that delivers the orders by riding his motorcycle. The motorcycle has an unlimited capacity of fuel tank. However, it is too old and can only ride 1 km for each 1 liter of fuel.\n\nThere are NNN fuel stations near the restaurant. The ithi^{th}ith fuel station can fill a fuel tank exactly KiK_{i}Ki\xe2\x80\x8b litres; not more and not less. Filling a fuel tank with any amount of fuel in those stations tends to take a long time. Since the fuel stations are placed near the restaurant, no fuel is needed to go to a fuel station.\n\nToday Chef Po received NNN pizza orders, which is the same number of fuel stations fortuitously. The house of the person that ordered the ithi^{th}ith order is HiH_{i}Hi\xe2\x80\x8b km away from the restaurant. The delivery boy cannot deliver more than one order at a time. Therefore, after delivering an order, he must return back to the restaurant to take the next order.\n\nThe delivery boy is an efficient person and thus he wants to fill the fuel tank with the exact amount of fuel required to deliver an order and return back. He also does not want to spends much time filling the tank, so he wants to minimize the number of times he fills the tank. Help him determine the minimum number of times he must fill the tank to deliver all orders.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer TTT denoting the number test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows. For each test case, the first line contains a single integer NNN. The second line contains NNN space-separated integers HiH_{i}Hi\xe2\x80\x8b. The third line contains NNN space-separated integers KiK_{i}Ki\xe2\x80\x8b.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the minimum number of times the delivery boy must fill the tank.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45001 \\leq T \\leq 5001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4500  1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45001 \\leq N \\leq 5001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4500  1\xe2\x89\xa4Hi\xe2\x89\xa45001 \\leq H_{i} \\leq 5001\xe2\x89\xa4Hi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4500  1\xe2\x89\xa4Ki\xe2\x89\xa45001 \\leq K_{i} \\leq 5001\xe2\x89\xa4Ki\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4500  There is at least one way for completing the deliveries.

Fill the tank twice in the first fuel station.\n\n\nFor the second order, the delivery boy must ride 2 + 2 = 4 km long. Fill the tank once in the second fuel station.\n\n\nFor the third order, the delivery boy must ride 3 + 3 = 6 km long. Fill the tank twice in the fourth fuel station.\n\n\nFor the fourth order, the delivery boy must ride 4 + 4 = 8 km long. Fill the tank in the third and fourth fuel stations.\n\n\nIn total, the delivery boy must fill the tank 7 times. There is no way to fill the tank less than 7 times.\n'
