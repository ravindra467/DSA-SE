b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nMotu and Tomu are very good friends who are always looking for new games to play against each other and ways to win these games. One day, they decided to play a new type of game with the following rules:\n\nThe game is played on a sequence A0,A1,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x88\x921A_0, A_1, \\dots, A_{N-1}A0\xe2\x80\x8b,A1\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x80\x8b.\nThe players alternate turns; Motu plays first, since he\'s earlier in lexicographical order.\nEach player has a score. The initial scores of both players are 000.\nOn his turn, the current player has to pick the element of AAA with the lowest index, add its value to his score and delete that element from the sequence AAA.\nAt the end of the game (when AAA is empty), Tomu wins if he has strictly greater score than Motu. Otherwise, Motu wins the game.\n\nIn other words, Motu starts by selecting A0A_0A0\xe2\x80\x8b, adding it to his score and then deleting it; then, Tomu selects A1A_1A1\xe2\x80\x8b, adds its value to his score and deletes it, and so on.\nMotu and Tomu already chose a sequence AAA for this game. However, since Tomu plays second, he is given a different advantage: before the game, he is allowed to perform at most KKK swaps in AAA; afterwards, the two friends are going to play the game on this modified sequence.\nNow, Tomu wants you to determine if it is possible to perform up to KKK swaps in such a way that he can win this game.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and KKK denoting the number of elements in the sequence and the maximum number of swaps Tomu can perform.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers A0,A1,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x88\x921A_0, A_1, \\dots, A_{N-1}A0\xe2\x80\x8b,A1\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if Tomu can win the game or "NO" otherwise (without quotes).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le T \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410,0001 \\le N \\le 10,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410,000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa410,0000 \\le K \\le 10,0000\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa410,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa410,0001 \\le A_i \\le 10,0001\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa410,000 for each valid iii\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le N \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\nSubtask #2 (80 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n6 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n5 1\n2 4 6 3 4NO\nYES\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: At the end of the game, both Motu and Tomu will have scores 1+1+1=31+1+1 = 31+1+1=3. Tomu is unable to win that game, so the output is "NO".\nExample case 2: If no swaps were performed, Motu\'s score would be 2+6+4=122+6+4 = 122+6+4=12 and Tomu\'s score would be 4+3=74+3 = 74+3=7. However, Tomu can swap the elements A2=6A_2 = 6A2\xe2\x80\x8b=6 and A3=3A_3 = 3A3\xe2\x80\x8b=3, which makes Motu\'s score at the end of the game equal to 2+3+4=92+3+4 = 92+3+4=9 and Tomu\'s score equal to 4+6=104+6 = 104+6=10. Tomu managed to score higher than Motu, so the output is "YES".'
