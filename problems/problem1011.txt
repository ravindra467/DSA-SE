b'Problem\nYou have R red, G green and B blue balloons. To decorate a single table for the banquet you need exactly three balloons. Three balloons attached to some table shouldn\'t have the same color. What maximum number N of tables can be decorated if we know number of balloons of each color?\nYour task is to write a program that for given values R, G and B will find the maximum number N of tables, that can be decorated in the required manner.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains 3 space separated integers R, G and B \xe2\x80\x94 the number of red, green and blue baloons respectively.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single integer N \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum number of tables that can be decorated in the required manner.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 R \xe2\x89\xa4 2*109\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 G \xe2\x89\xa4 2*109\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 B \xe2\x89\xa4 2*109\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n5 4 3\n1 1 1\n2 3 3\nOutput:\n4\n1\n2\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. You can decorate the tables with the following balloon sets: "rgg", "gbb", "brr", "rrg", where "r", "g" and "b" represent the red, green and blue balls, respectively.'
