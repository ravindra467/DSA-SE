b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nA round-robin tournament is being held in Chefland among N teams numbered 1,2,...,N1,2,...,N1,2,...,N. Every team play with all other teams exactly\\textbf{exactly}exactly once. All games have only two possible results - win or loss. A win yields 222 points to the winning team while a loss yields no points. What is the maximum number of points a team finishing at the KthK^{th}Kth position can score?\nNote:\\textbf{Note:}Note: If two teams have the same points then the team with the higher team number achieves the better rank.\nInput Format\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nEach testcase contains a single line of input, two space-separated integers N,KN, KN,K.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each testcase, output in a single line an integer - the maximum points the team ranked KKK in the round-robin tournament can score.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq T \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq K \\leq N \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n3 3\n4 1\n7 4\n2\n6\n8\n\nExplanation:\nTest Case 111: There are 333 teams in the tournament. The maximum score will be achieved by the team coming 3rd3^{rd}3rd when all teams win 111 match and lose the other one. Hence the maximum possible score will be 2(2\xe2\x8b\x851)2(2 \\cdot 1)2(2\xe2\x8b\x851)  points.\nTest Case 222: There are 444 teams in the tournament. The maximum score will be achieved by the team coming 1st1^{st}1st when they beat all teams in the tournament. Hence the maximum possible score will be 6(2\xe2\x8b\x853)6(2 \\cdot 3)6(2\xe2\x8b\x853) points.'
