b'Problem\nDio has recently been watching too much Jojo\'s Bizzare Adventure anime. As a result of this he always speaks the word "Muda" when ending a sentence. His birthday is fast approaching and you as his best friend decides to gift him a string that contains at least one word "Muda". But unfortunately the string that you bought from the shop may not contain any such word. So you decide to change some characters to any other character so that the string contains at least one "Muda". Your task is to output the minimum numbers of operations that you need to perform such that the string contains at least one "Muda".\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nEach testcase contains of a single line the string SSS.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line the minimum number of operations required.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq T \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n4\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa41054 \\leq |S| \\leq 10^54\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\nSubtasks\n\n100 points: Original Constraints\n\nSample Input:\n1\r\nafdMdda\n\nSample Output:\n1\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThe substring S[4..7] = "Mdda" requires only S[5] to be changed to character \'u\'. Therefore the minimum number of operations is 1.\nRemember \'M\' is different from \'m\' .'
