b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.\nAs everybody knows, Reza Shiri is the favourite Iranian artist. Since we love Reza Shiri and his songs, we never download them for free. Reza Shiri\xe2\x80\x99s songs must be purchased from authorised stores. However, what if there is not enough money to buy all the songs?\nThere are NNN songs (numbered 111 through NNN) and MMM albums (numbered 111 through MMM) available. For each valid iii, the iii-th song has greatness viv_ivi\xe2\x80\x8b, price pip_ipi\xe2\x80\x8b and belongs to the album aia_iai\xe2\x80\x8b. For each valid iii, the iii-th album has price bib_ibi\xe2\x80\x8b. If we buy an album, then all songs from this album count as bought. It is also possible to buy any songs individually.\nYour task is simple \xe2\x80\x95 given the budget PPP (the amount of money we have), calculate the maximum total greatness of songs we can buy. The total greatness is defined as the sum of greatness values of all distinct songs that are bought (either individually or as part of albums).\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers NNN, MMM and PPP.\nNNN lines follow.
