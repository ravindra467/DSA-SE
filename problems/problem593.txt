b'Problem\nProblem Statement\nYour hunter friend Sova has a crush on Reyna. Reyna has finally decided to go for a date with Sova ( In a hypothetical world of course ). Sova being a highly desperate fellow wants to reach her as soon as possible and keep her from waiting as Reyna is a short tempered person.\nSova has lost his recon bow that locates people and is unable to find out the path to reach Reyna. Sova needs your help in finding a path to reach his love Reyna.\nSova\xe2\x80\x99s city (icebox) can be represented as a NNN * MMM  grid consisting of NNN rows and MMM columns. You are given one starting point  VVV ( Sova\xe2\x80\x99s current location in icebox), one ending point  SSS  (Reyna\xe2\x80\x99s location in icebox) and the rest of the points as either PPP or OOO.  PPP denotes an obstacle meaning you cannot pass through it while OOO denotes a valid cell you can pass through.\nYou can move in any of the four directions i.e. if you are at point (i,j) you can move to\n( i , j + 1)\n( i , j - 1 )\n( i + 1 , j)\n( i - 1 ,  j)\nInput Format\nThe first line contains 2 space separated integers NNN, MMM denoting dimensions of the grid.\nNext NNN lines contain MMM characters each without spaces consisting of PPP \xe2\x80\x99s,  OOO \xe2\x80\x99s, VVV and SSS . The input contains exactly one  VVV and exactly one SSS.\nConstraints\n4 \xe2\x89\xa4 NNN  *  MMM \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\nOutput Format\nPrint a single line containing minimum steps that Sova needs to reach Reyna\xe2\x80\x99s location.\nSample Input\n3 3\nOVO\nOPO\nSOO\nSample Output\n3\nExplanation\nThere exist 2 possible paths from VVV to SSS. The path (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) is the shortest that requires 3 steps.'
