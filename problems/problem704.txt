b'Problem\nChef is taking a tough examination. The question paper consists of NNN objective problems and each problem has 444 options A,B,C,A, B, C,A,B,C, and DDD, out of which, exactly one option is correct.\nSince Chef did not study for the exam, he does not know the answer to any of the problems. Chef was looking nearby for help when his friend somehow communicated the following information:\n\nExactly NAN_ANA\xe2\x80\x8b problems have option AAA as the answer.\nExactly NBN_BNB\xe2\x80\x8b problems have option BBB as the answer.\nExactly NCN_CNC\xe2\x80\x8b problems have option CCC as the answer.\nExactly NDN_DND\xe2\x80\x8b problems have option DDD as the answer.\n\nNote that:\n\nNA+NB+NC+ND=NN_A + N_B + N_C + N_D = NNA\xe2\x80\x8b+NB\xe2\x80\x8b+NC\xe2\x80\x8b+ND\xe2\x80\x8b=N.\nEach problem is worth exactly 111 mark and there is no negative marking.\nEven though Chef knows the number of correct options of each type, he does not know the correct answer to any problem.\n\nBased on the given information, find the maximum marks Chef can guarantee if he marks the answers optimally.\nInput Format\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nFirst line of each test case contains an integer NNN denoting the number of problems.\nSecond line of each test case contains 444 integers NA,NB,NC,N_A, N_B, N_C,NA\xe2\x80\x8b,NB\xe2\x80\x8b,NC\xe2\x80\x8b, and NDN_DND\xe2\x80\x8b - as mentioned in the problem statement.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output the maximum marks Chef can guarantee if he marks the answers optimally.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq T \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4NA,NB,NC,ND\xe2\x89\xa4N0 \\leq N_A, N_B, N_C, N_D \\leq N0\xe2\x89\xa4NA\xe2\x80\x8b,NB\xe2\x80\x8b,NC\xe2\x80\x8b,ND\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4N\nNA+NB+NC+ND=NN_A + N_B + N_C + N_D = NNA\xe2\x80\x8b+NB\xe2\x80\x8b+NC\xe2\x80\x8b+ND\xe2\x80\x8b=N\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n5\n0 0 5 0\n10\n7 1 1 1\n5\n7\n\nExplanation:\nTest Case 111: Chef knows that all the problems have answer as option CCC and thus he will mark all the answers as CCC and get 555 marks.\nTest Case 222: It will be optimal for Chef to mark all the options as AAA which will yield him 777 marks. Thus, irrespective of the answer key, Chef can guarantee 777 marks by marking all answers as option AAA.'
