b'Problem\nAs the name of our college "Government College of Engineering & Textile Technology Berhampore" is too long, many students usually misspell the name.\nHence our college has decided to reject any application, if more than 50% characters of any word is wrong.\nYou need to calculate if a application will be accepted or rejected.\nNote : It is guaranteed that each word in input consists of equal no. of characters as college name. Also, They are not case sensitive.\nInput:\n\nFirst line contains TTT no. of test cases\nfor every test case, a line containing the name written in the application.\n\nOutput:\nFor every test case print acceptacceptaccept  or rejectrejectreject in new line\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4501 \\leq T \\leq 501\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa450\n\nSample Input:\n3\ngovernment college of engineering &amp; textile technology berhampore\nGovernment collage of Enjineering &amp; taxtile tachnology berhampure\ngovernment college of engineering &amp; textile technology Baharampor\n### Sample Output:\naccept\naccept\nreject\n### EXPLANATION:\n\nFirst case, every word are same so accepted.\nSecond case, in 2nd word 1 out of 7 characters mismatch. Hence passed. Again, in 4th, 6th and 7th, 8th word 1,1,1,2 out of 11, 8, 10,10 mismatched ( < 50% ). Hence accepted\nIn third case, 9 character mismatch from berhampore ( total 10 chars ). So, more than 50% mismatch ( 9 >5 ) hence reject'
