b"Problem\nPlease note that the two versions of this problem differ only by constraints. The problem statement is exactly the same in both.\nYou are given two strings AAA and BBB of lengths NNN and MMM respectively. Find the maximum length of a substring of AAA that is also present in BBB. Let this maximum length be KKK. Also, find all such substrings of length KKK that is present in both AAA and BBB and print the number of times each such substring occurs in BBB.\nInput:\n\nFirst line contains a single integer TTT, the number of test cases.\nFirst line of each test case contains two space-separated integers, NNN and MMM.\nSecond line of each test case contains two space-separated strings, AAA and BBB.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, output in the first line KKK, the maximum length of a common substring. Then follows XXX lines of output, where XXX denotes the number of substrings in AAA of length KKK that is also present in BBB. In each such line, print the substring of length KKK present in both the strings and the number of times that substring occurs in BBB (separated by a single space). The substrings must follow a lexicographic order, i.e., you must first print the substring that will occur earlier in a dictionary than the others.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45001 \\leq T \\leq 5001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4500\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x88\x971041 \\leq N,M \\leq 5*10^41\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x88\x97104\nSum of NNN over all test cases doesn't exceed 10510^5105\nSum of MMM over all test cases doesn't exceed 10510^5105\nAll strings consist of lowercase latin letters only\n\nSample Input:\n4\n14 17\npqfwkhopkmcoqh yggxxpklorellnmpa\n1 16\nq bcnuvqhffbsaqxwp\n4 20\nrxsj owkkyhiddqscdxrjmowf\n6 7\ndrrwso qfjmafa\nSample Output:\n2\npk 1\n1\nq 2\n1\nj 1\nr 1\ns 1\nx 1\n0"
