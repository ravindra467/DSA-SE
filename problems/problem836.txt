b'Problem\nThe Chef has been hunting for a machine developed to change numbers in a rather peculiar manner. This machine has a fixed number ccc associated with it and a changing number XXX.\nIn a single step, the Chef can do the following:\n\nFirst, choose any positive integer bbb that is a perfect ccc-th power of some number (that is, there is some positive integer nnn such that b=ncb = n^cb=nc)\nThen, change X\xe2\x86\x92lcm(b,X)gcd\xe2\x81\xa1(b,X)X \\to \\dfrac{\\text{lcm}(b, X)}{\\gcd(b, X)}X\xe2\x86\x92gcd(b,X)lcm(b,X)\xe2\x80\x8b\n\nHe wants to find the minimum number he can change XXX into by applying these operations alone any number of times (possibly none at all). However, he does not know the exact values of X,cX, cX,c for the machine, but he does have TTT guesses for what these values might be. For each of these guesses, compute the minimum number Chef can obtain.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input will contain an integer TTT, the number of guesses Chef has for the pair (X,c)(X, c)(X,c). Then the guesses follow.\nEach guess consists of a single line of input containing two space-separated integers X,cX, cX,c.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each guess, print on a new line the minimum value that Chef can change XXX into by applying any number of operations (possibly none at all).\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq T \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa410101 \\leq X \\leq 10^{10}1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa41010\n1\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa4301 \\leq c \\leq 301\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa430\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n1 5\n10 1\n20 41\n1\n20\nExplanation:\nGuess 111: It can easily be checked that X=1X = 1X=1 cannot be changed.\nGuess 222: Choose b=101b = 10^1b=101 and change X:10\xe2\x86\x92lcm(10,10)gcd\xe2\x81\xa1(10,10)=1X : 10 \\to \\dfrac{\\text{lcm}(10, 10)}{\\gcd(10, 10)} = 1X:10\xe2\x86\x92gcd(10,10)lcm(10,10)\xe2\x80\x8b=1. This is the minimum possible value of XXX.'
