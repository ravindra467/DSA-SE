b'Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nGiven a string s. Can you make it a palindrome by deleting exactly one character? Note that size of the string after deletion would be one less than it was before. \nInput\nFirst line of the input contains a single integer T denoting number of test cases.\nFor each test case, you are given a single line containing string  s. \nOutput\nFor each test case, print YES or NO depending on the answer of the problem. \nConstraints\n\n Subtask 1, 35 points \n 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4  size of string s \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n String s contains lowercase English alphabets (ie. from \'a\' to \'z\').\n\n Subtask 2, 65 points \n2 \xe2\x89\xa4  size of string s \xe2\x89\xa4 10^5\n Sum of size of string s over all the input test cases won\'t exceed 10^6\n String s contains lowercase English alphabets (ie. from \'a\' to \'z\').\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4\naaa\nabc\nabdbca\nabbaYES\nNO\nYES\nYES\nExplanation:\nExample case 1. Delete any one \'a\', resulting string is "aa" which is a palindrome.\nExample case 2. It is not possible to delete exactly one character and having a palindrome.\nExample case 3. Delete \'c\', resulting string is "abdba" which is a palindrome. \nExample case 4. Delete \'b\', resulting string is "aba" which is a palindrome. '
