b"Problem\nAlice and Bob live in a country in which there are NNN cities (numbered from 111 to NNN) connected to each other using N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 bidirectional roads in such a way that any two cities are reachable from each other.\nThis country has a special property: for each city in the country, there are at most 666 roads directly connected to it.\nAlice and Bob both decide to go on a tour of the country, starting from city number 111. Alice uses Depth First traversal (DFS) order to travel through all the NNN cities while Bob uses Breadth First Traversal (BFS) order. At any city, if there is more than one possibility for the next city to be visited, then each option is equally likely to be chosen by both Alice and Bob.\nThe pseudocode of their respective traversals are as follows:\n// Alice's DFS traversal\ndfs(u):\n    // Let C denote the set of children of u\n    shuffle(C)\n    // Let the current state of C be [C[1], C[2], ..., C[k]]\n    for i from 1 to k:\n        dfs(C[i])\n\n// Bob's BFS traversal\nqueue Q\nQ.push(1)\nwhile Q is not empty:\n    u = front(Q)\n    pop(Q)\n    // Let C denote the set of children of u\n    shuffle(C)\n    // Let the current state of C be [C[1], C[2], ..., C[k]]\n    for i from 1 to k:\n        Q.push(C[i])\n\nDefine the index of a city in some traversal order to be the number of distinct cities visited before that city during that traversal. Find the expected number of cities whose index in Bob's traversal is strictly less than its index in Alice's traversal.\nIt can be shown that this expected value can be expressed as a fraction PQ\\frac{P}{Q}QP\xe2\x80\x8b, where PPP and QQQ are coprime integers, P\xe2\x89\xa50P \\ge 0P\xe2\x89\xa50, Q>0Q \\gt 0Q>0 and QQQ is coprime with 998244353998244353998244353. You should compute (P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921)(mod998\xe2\x80\x89244\xe2\x80\x89353)(P \\cdot Q^{-1}) \\pmod {998\\,244\\,353}(P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921)(mod998244353), where Q\xe2\x88\x921Q^{-1}Q\xe2\x88\x921 denotes the multiplicative inverse of QQQ modulo 998\xe2\x80\x89244\xe2\x80\x89353998\\,244\\,353998244353.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input will contain a single integer TTT, denoting the number of test cases.\nEach test case consists of multiple lines of input.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integers NNN \xe2\x80\x94 the number of cities.\nThe next N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 lines describe the roads.
