b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nThere are NNN people in a train and each of them gets on the train at time t=0t = 0t=0.\nEach person on the train wants to use the charging station on the train for some amount of time, but unfortunately, the train has only one charging station and can only be used by 111 person at any point in time.\nThe ithi^{th}ith person wants to use the charging station for AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b minutes in total and will leave the train at time TiT_iTi\xe2\x80\x8b.\nA person will be satisfied after the journey, only if that person gets to use the charging station for the desired amount of time.\nFind a way to schedule the charging such that a maximum number of people is satisfied.\nIn order to schedule, you can pick any interval of time, say [L,R)[L, R)[L,R), and ask the person iii to use the charging station from t=Lt = Lt=L and leave just before t=Rt = Rt=R.\nAfter this the person iii would have spent R\xe2\x88\x92LR - LR\xe2\x88\x92L minutes on the charging station and any person who is still on the train can begin using the charging station starting from t=Rt = Rt=R.\nAn interval scheduling will be a set of time intervals and people assigned to those intervals.\nA schedule is valid if:\n\nNo two intervals in the schedule intersect each other. Note that all [L,R)[L, R)[L,R) and [R,S)[R, S)[R,S) do not intersect each other.\nFor all people iii and all intervals [L,R)[L, R)[L,R) assigned to iii, 0\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4Ti0 \\leq L \\leq R \\leq T_i0\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4Ti\xe2\x80\x8b, i.e. each person is not assigned to an interval of time when they are not on the train.\n\nYou have to find optimal scheduling that does not contain more than 2N2N2N intervals.\nIt is guaranteed that there always exists optimal scheduling with the given constraints.\nIf there are many such schedules, you can output any of them.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains a single integer QQQ denoting the number of test cases. The description of QQQ test cases follows.\nEach test case contains 333 lines of input.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN, the number of people on the train.\nThe second line of each test case contains NNN space-separated integers, A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6ANA_1, A_2, \\dots A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6AN\xe2\x80\x8b, where AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b is the amount of time that the ithi^{th}ith person needs to use the charger.\nThe third line of each test case contains NNN space separated integers, T1,T2,\xe2\x80\xa6TnT_1, T_2, \\dots T_nT1\xe2\x80\x8b,T2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6Tn\xe2\x80\x8b, where TiT_iTi\xe2\x80\x8b is the time at which the ithi^{th}ith person leaves the train.\n\nOutput Format\n\nFor each test case, in the first line, print a single integer M(\xe2\x89\xa42N)M (\\leq 2N)M(\xe2\x89\xa42N), the number of different intervals that you want to schedule.\nMMM lines follow. For each valid iii, the ithi^{th}ith of these lines should contain three space-separated integers, i,L,Ri, L, Ri,L,R denoting that the person iii should use the charging station from [L,R)[L, R)[L,R).\nThe number of satisfied people should be maximum.\nThe scheduling should be valid.\nIt is possible to schedule the same person multiple times.\nThe order in which the intervals are displayed does not matter.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851051 \\leq  Q \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851051 \\leq N \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851050 \\leq A_i \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^50\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105  for each valid iii\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ti\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851050 \\leq T_i \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^50\xe2\x89\xa4Ti\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105  for each valid iii\nThe sum of NNN over all testcases does not exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x85105 3 \\cdot 10^53\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\n\nSubtasks\n\n\nSubtask #1 (10 points) : TiT_iTi\xe2\x80\x8b-s are equal for all NNN people\nSubtask #2 (90 points) : Original constraints\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4\n5\n31 32 6 13 7\n14 50 34 4 31\n5\n43 26 22 11 30\n26 4 41 46 49\n5\n36 40 49 19 37\n18 11 48 15 33\n5\n16 3 24 21 21\n24 31 36 49 503\n3 0 6\n5 6 13\n2 13 45\n2\n4 0 11\n3 11 33\n0\n3\n2 0 3\n1 3 19\n4 19 40\nExplanation:\nTest case 1: Person 111 and Person 444 can never be satisfied because the time they spend on the train (141414 and 444 respectively) is less than the amount of time they want to spend for charging. The other three people can be assigned as shown (Person 333 in the interval [0,6)[0, 6)[0,6), Person 555 in the interval [6,13)[6, 13)[6,13) and finally Person 222 in the interval [13,45)[13, 45)[13,45). Note that there are multiple solutions, for example, we could have also assigned Person 555 to [0,7)[0, 7)[0,7) and Person 333 to [7,13)[7, 13)[7,13) instead. Both are considered correct.\nTest case 2: Person 111 and Person 222 can never be satisfied (they spend less time on the train than the amount of time they need to use the charging station). Among the remaining three, we cannot satisfy all of them, since the total time required would be 30+11+22=6330 + 11 + 22 = 6330+11+22=63, but t=49t = 49t=49, all of them would have left the train. However we can select either Persons 333 and Person 444 or Person 444 and Person 555 and schedule them in any order, and in both cases, both of the persons would be satisfied.\nTest case 3: No one can be satisfied and hence the answer is 000.\nTest case 4: Apart from Person 222 (who has a very low charging time), we cannot hope to satisfy more than 222 of the others. This is because the sum of the 333 least times is already 585858 and everyone would have left the train by t=50t = 50t=50. Therefore the maximum number of people we can hope to satisfy is 333, and the given solution constructs it.'
