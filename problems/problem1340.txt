b"Problem\nMister J is a very distinguished professor, but he also has a dark side to him. He feels being free is a waste of time and therefore he wants his students to be permanently busy.\nThe students have NNN vacation days, which are v1,v2,\xe2\x80\xa6,vnv_1, v_2, \\dots, v_nv1\xe2\x80\x8b,v2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,vn\xe2\x80\x8b (all distinct). Administration ensures that students get a minimum of 4 such vacation days.\nMister J has a set of projects, each of which occupies the students from DDD to D+T\xe2\x88\x921D+T-1D+T\xe2\x88\x921 days (inclusive) from the announcement date DDD. (Different projects' timelines may or may not overlap)\nHe can deploy at most MMM projects, each of which occupies the students for the same number of days TTT. He can choose any announcement date DDD for each project (it can be different for different projects).\nBut he does not want to get into trouble with the administration for issuing very lengthy projects. So he needs your help in finding the minimum integer value of TTT such that he is still able to use his set of MMM projects to occupy the students for every single vacation-day that they get.\nMister J doesn't want the projects to be too short, so he ensures that the number of projects MMM is less than the number of days NNN.\nInput\nThe first line of input contains 2 integers NNN (4\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41054 \\leq N \\leq 10^54\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105) and MMM (1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa425,M<N1 \\le M \\le 25, M \\lt N1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa425,M<N).\nThe next line contains NNN space-separated integers v1,\xe2\x80\xa6,vNv_1, \\dots, v_Nv1\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,vN\xe2\x80\x8b (1\xe2\x89\xa4vi\xe2\x89\xa4108)(1 \\leq v_i \\leq 10^8)(1\xe2\x89\xa4vi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4108) (all viv_ivi\xe2\x80\x8b are distinct)\nOutput\nOutput only one integer, the minimum possible value of TTT.\nSample Input 1\n6 4\n2 1 5 6 12 11\n\nSample Output 1\n2\n\nExplanation\nMister J can deploy three projects.\nThe first project will cover the vacation days 1 and 2, the second project will cover the vacation days 5 and 6, and the last project will cover the vacation days 11 and 12.\nTherefore, we can minimize the project length to 2 days, cover all the vacation days, and give \xe2\x89\xa44\\leq 4\xe2\x89\xa44 projects.\nHack case note\nFind the buggy solution to this problem on GitHub or Drive.\nThis problem is part of DeCode contest, wherein you are given a problem (as given above) and its buggy solution (link in contest announcement). You have to submit a program that outputs a hack case to the buggy solution. Your program's output should satisfy the input constraints of the above problem."
