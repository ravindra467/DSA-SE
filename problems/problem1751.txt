b'Problem\n\nThe aliens living in outer space are very advanced in technology, \nintelligence and everything, except one, and that is Cooking. \nEach year they spend millions of dollars in research, to crack famous recipes prepared by humans.\n\nRecently they came to know about Khana-Academy, \na non-profit organization streaming free cooking lesson videos on earth. \nThere are N recipes, \nnumbered 1 to N, and the video of the ith recipe is live in the time interval [Si, Ei]. \nAn alien can visit earth but can not survive for more than just a small moment (earth is so advanced in pollution). \nAn alien visits the earth at an integer time t and instantly downloads the complete video of all the lessons \nthat are live at that moment of time t and leaves earth immediately. \nYou are given the visiting times of a small group of K aliens. \nFind the number of different recipes aliens can learn by watching the downloaded videos. \nNot just one group of aliens, there are Q such groups, \nso you have to find the answer for each of these Q groups.\nInput\n\nThe first line has an integer N. \nEach of the following N lines has two integers Si Ei. \nThe next line has an integer Q, the number of groups. \nEach of the following Q lines has information of a group of aliens. \nThe first integer is K, the number of aliens in that group, followed by K integers in the same line, \nthe integer visiting times t of the aliens.\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100000 (105)\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xe2\x89\xa4 5000 (5 \xc2\xb7 103)\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 20\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Si, Ei, t \xe2\x89\xa4 1000000000 (109)\nSi < Ei\nOutput\n\nFor each of the Q groups, output the number of different recipes that group of aliens can learn by watching the downloaded videos.\nExample\nInput:\n4\n1 4\n3 10\n2 6\n5 8\n3\n1 5\n2 2 6\n3 1 10 9\n\nOutput:\n3\n4\n2\n\n\nExplanation:\nGiven videos of 4 recipes in the following closed intervals.\n1. [ 1 , 4 ]\n2. [ 3 , 10 ]\n3. [ 2 , 6 ]\n4. [ 5 , 8 ]\n\nIn the first query, only one alien arrives at t = 5 and can download 3 recipes 2, 3, 4.\nIn the second query, two aliens arrive at t = 2 and 6. They can learn all the 4 recipes.\nIn the third query, three aliens arrive at t = 1, 10 and 9. They can learn only two recipes, 1 and 2.'
