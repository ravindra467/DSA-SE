b"Problem\nThere is a binary string SSS. Alice and Bob are playing a game on it.\nEach turn, the following happens:\n\nAlice selects a 010101 subsequence in SSS and removes it from SSS. (a 010101 subsequence is a length 222 subsequence whose first character is 000 and second character is 111)\nBob selects a 010101 subsequence in SSS and removes it from SSS.\nAfter both players have moved, the turn is called completed and Alice scores 111 point. Then, the next turn begins.\n\nIf either player is unable to move (there isn't any 010101 subsequence left in SSS), that turn ends immediately and the game ends.\nAlice tries to maximize her points, while Bob tries to minimize Alice's points. Find how many points Alice would score if both players play optimally.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains a single integer TTT \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases.\nEach of the next TTT lines contains a binary string SSS.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output on a new line a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 Alice's score when both players play optimally.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051 \\leq T \\leq 2\\cdot 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\nThe sum of \xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3|S|\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3 across all tests doesn't exceed  2\xe2\x8b\x851052 \\cdot 10^52\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\n\nSubtasks\n\n\nSubtask 1 (25 Points):\n\nThe sum of \xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3|S|\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3 across all tests doesn't exceed 100100100\n\n\nSubtask 2 (25 Points):\n\nThe sum of \xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3|S|\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3 across all tests doesn't exceed 150015001500\n\n\nSubtask 3 (50 Points):\n\nNo further constraints.\n\n\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4\n01010101\n0101\n10\n01001011\n1 \n1 \n0 \n2 \n\nExplanation:\nIn the first example, this is one of the possible outcomes.\nTurn 111:\n\nAlice removes subsequence (1,2)(1, 2)(1,2) from SSS, so SSS becomes 010101.\nBob removes subsequence (3,6)(3, 6)(3,6) from SSS, so SSS becomes 0110.\nAlice scores one point and the first turn ends.\n\nTurn 2:\n\nAlice removes subsequence (1,2)(1, 2)(1,2) from SSS, so SSS becomes 10.\nBob has nothing to do, so the game ends immediately.\n\nThus, Alice has one point in total."
