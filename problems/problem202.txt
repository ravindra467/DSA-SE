b'Problem\n\xc2\xa0\nFlash and QuickSilver challenge each other to a faceoff. They stand at the top of a huge staircase where the steps are numbered from n down to 1. In a single step, they can step down from stair n to stair n-1. Afraid of losing the challenge, flash bribes the judge and figures out a few tricks. If the stair number n is divisible by 2, he can jump directly to stair numbered n/2 in a single step. If the stair number n is divisble by 3, Flash can then jump directly to stair numbered n/3 in a single step. In order to win, one needs to reach the stair numbered 1, in minimum time. Assuming that both of them can take 1 step in 1 sec, calculate the minimum time required by Flash to reach the stair numbered 1.\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\nThe first line contains a positive integer t, denoting the number of test cases.\nThe only line of each test case contains a single positive integer n, denoting the number of stairs in the staircase.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the minimum time required(in seconds) by Flash to reach the stair number 1.\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 t \xe2\x89\xa4 10000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n3\n1\n6\n10\nOutput:\n0\n2\n3\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nExample case 1.\nSince Flash is already at stair numbered 1, he will take no time.\n\nExample case 2.\nFlash is  at stair numbered 6, 6 -> 3, 3 -> 1. Hence he takes 2 seconds to reach the stair number 1.\n\nExample case 3.\nFlash is  at stair numbered 10, 10 -> 9, 9 -> 3, 3 -> 1. Hence he takes 3  seconds to reach the stair number 1'
