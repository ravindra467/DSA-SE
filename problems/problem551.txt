b'Problem\nAs the zombie apocalypse is at its peak and there is rising tensions among nations for getting a hold of the zombie cure.\nThe cure is available as NNN batches and each batch contains AiAiAi vials of the cure. Two superpowers are battling for the same. As a UN peace advocate, Prof Paradox, refuses to sort this quarrel out, turning it into the next World War. You, on the other hand, are determined to avoid another possible doomsday scenario.\nYou have to split the NNN batches into 222 equal shares, such that each party gets an equal number of vials of cures without splitting any batch. You may even choose to discard some batches to ensure equal shares.\nFind the maximum number of vials that each nation can get and prevent this war.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nFirst line of each testcase contains of a single integers NNN, the number of batches of cure.\nSecond line of each testcase contains NNN integers, each denoting the number of vials of cure\r\npresent in each batch.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, Find the maximum number of vials that each nation can get and prevent this war. If you can\xe2\x80\x99t divide the vials equally print zero.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq T \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41002 \\leq N \\leq 1002\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\nSum(Ai)\xe2\x89\xa410000 Sum(Ai) \\leq 10000Sum(Ai)\xe2\x89\xa410000\n\nSubtasks\n\n10 points : 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq N \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410 , 1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq Ai \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa410\n90 points : Original constraints\n\nSample Input:\n2\r\n4\r\n1 2 3 6\r\n6\r\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n\nSample Output:\n6\r\n10\n\nEXPLANATION 1:\nWe can divide the batches into [1,2,3][1, 2, 3][1,2,3] and [6][6][6], which have the same number of vials = 666.'
