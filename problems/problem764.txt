b'Problem\nThere is a town with NNN people and initially, the ithi^{th}ith person has AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b coins. However, some people of the town decide to become monks. If the ithi^{th}ith person becomes a monk, then:\n\nHe leaves the town thereby reducing the number of people in the town by 111.\nHe distributes XXX (0\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4Ai)(0 \\le X \\le A_i)(0\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b) coins to the remaining people of the town (not necessarily equally). Note that each monk can freely choose his value of XXX, and different monks may choose different values of XXX.\nHe takes the remaining Ai\xe2\x88\x92XA_i - XAi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\x92X coins with him.\n\nFor example, initially, if A=[1,3,4,5]A = [1, 3, 4, 5]A=[1,3,4,5] and 4th4^{th}4th person decides to become a monk then he can leave the town and can give 222 coins to the 1st1^{st}1st person, 111 coin to the 2nd2^{nd}2nd person, no coins to the 3rd3^{rd}3rd person and take 222 coins along with him while going. Now AAA becomes [3,4,4][3, 4, 4][3,4,4].\nDetermine the minimum number of people who have to become monks, so that in the end, everyone remaining in the town has an equal number of coins.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains a single integer TTT \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer NNN \xe2\x80\x94 the number of people in the town.\nThe second line of each test case contains NNN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b denoting the initial number of coins of everyone in the town.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output the minimum number of people who have to become monks, so that in the end, everyone remaining in the town has an equal number of coins.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le T \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le N \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\le A_i \\le 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\nSum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052 \\cdot 10^52\xe2\x8b\x85105.\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n4\n6 6 6 6\n3\n5 1 4\n5\n2 1 2 1 1\n0\n1\n2\n\nExplanation:\nTest case 111: All the people already have an equal number of coins.\nTest case 222: The 2nd2^{nd}2nd person can become a monk and give his 111 coin to the person with 444 coins. After this, both the remaining people will have 555 coins.\nTest case 333: One way of two people becoming monks is as follows:\n\nThe 2nd2^{nd}2nd person becomes a monk, and takes his 111 coin with him\nThe 3rd3^{rd}3rd person becomes a monk, and gives one coin each to the 4th4^{th}4th and 5th5^{th}5th people\n\nEveryone remaining in the town now has 222 coins.'
