b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nRafid is teaching his students plane geometry. Today they are talking about convex polygons. A convex polygon is a simple non-degenerate polygon such that each of its internal angles is strictly smaller than 180\xe2\x88\x98180^\\circ180\xe2\x88\x98.\nRafid drew NNN points (numbered 111 through NNN) on a blackboard (a two-dimensional plane) and told each student to choose some of the points and connect them to obtain a convex polygon. For each valid iii, the coordinates of the iii-th point are (Xi,Yi)(X_i, Y_i)(Xi\xe2\x80\x8b,Yi\xe2\x80\x8b).\nThere are KKK students (numbered 111 through KKK). To prevent the students from choosing the same polygon over and over, Rafid told them that they have to choose polygons one by one in the order from student 111 to student KKK and each student has to choose a set of points which was not chosen by any earlier student. That means they have to choose KKK different sets of points, resulting in KKK different polygons. As a result, some students may end up unable to choose any polygon.\nTo encourage the students, Rafid announced that each student will receive a number of candies proportional to the area of this student's polygon. The students are very greedy, so the first student will choose the polygon with the largest area, the second student will choose the polygon with the largest area which does not use the same set of points as the first student's polygon, and so on.\nFor each student, help Rafid find the area of the polygon chosen by this student or determine that this student cannot choose a polygon anymore. Note that while there may be many ways in which the students could choose their polygons, their areas are uniquely determined.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers NNN and KKK.\nNNN lines follow. For each valid iii, the iii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers XiX_iXi\xe2\x80\x8b and YiY_iYi\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single line containing KKK space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AKA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_KA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AK\xe2\x80\x8b. For each valid iii, AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b should be twice the area of a polygon chosen by the iii-th student, or \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 if all possible polygons have already been chosen by students before the iii-th student.\nConstraints\n\n3\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41203 \\leq N \\leq 1203\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4120\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\leq K \\leq 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4106\n\xe2\x88\xa3Xi\xe2\x88\xa3,\xe2\x88\xa3Yi\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4106|X_i|, |Y_i| \\leq 10^6\xe2\x88\xa3Xi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\xa3,\xe2\x88\xa3Yi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4106 for each valid iii\nthe points (X1,Y1),(X2,Y2),\xe2\x80\xa6,(XN,YN)(X_1, Y_1), (X_2, Y_2), \\ldots, (X_N, Y_N)(X1\xe2\x80\x8b,Y1\xe2\x80\x8b),(X2\xe2\x80\x8b,Y2\xe2\x80\x8b),\xe2\x80\xa6,(XN\xe2\x80\x8b,YN\xe2\x80\x8b) are pairwise distinct\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (5 points):\n\nK=2K = 2K=2\nit is possible to form at least KKK convex polygons\n\nSubtask #2 (15 points): K\xe2\x89\xa41,000K \\leq 1,000K\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nSubtask #3 (80 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput5 15\n0 0\n10 0\n10 10\n0 10\n5 5200 100 100 100 100 50 50 50 50 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1\nExplanation:\nThe following figure describes the points and some polygons.\n\n\nThe first student chooses the largest polygon ABCD\\mathsf{ABCD}ABCD with area 100100100.\nThe next four students choose the triangles ABC\\mathsf{ABC}ABC, BCD\\mathsf{BCD}BCD, CDA\\mathsf{CDA}CDA and DAB\\mathsf{DAB}DAB, each with area 505050.
