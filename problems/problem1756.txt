b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.\nBob is currently at origin. Bob walks on XXX-axis and towards the right. In one move, Bob can either jump 1 unit to the right or 2 units to the right. Some of these coordinates are dirty. Bob wants to know the number of ways going to (Y,0)(Y, 0)(Y,0) from (0,0)(0, 0)(0,0). Two ways are considered to be different if there exists an integer jjj such that the location of Bob after jjj steps is different.\nSounds like a well known problem? Bob quickly came up with a perfect solution.\nA valid path should contain \'.\' which represents a clean coordinate or \'#\' which represents a dirty coordinate.\nIf the length of the path is LENLENLEN, then Bob\'s program calculates and prints number of ways to reach (LEN\xe2\x88\x921,0)(LEN-1, 0)(LEN\xe2\x88\x921,0) from (0,0)(0, 0)(0,0).\nAn integer XXX is considered to be a good integer if Bob\'s program prints XXX for some valid path.\nYou have to write a program to output YYY, where YYY is NthN^{th}Nth good number in the range LLL to RRR. You should also print the valid path that would make Bob\'s program output YYY.\nIf there are multiple valid paths, you can output any of them. Please see the output section for more details.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer TTT, denoting the number of test cases.\nEach test case contains 3 space separated integers LLL, RRR, and NNN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the NthN^{th}Nth good number, followed by space, followed by a valid path. If no such number exists, just output \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921.\nA valid path should contain \'.\' which represent a clean coordinate or \'#\' which represents a dirty coordinate.\nFor example, "..##.." represents 666 coordinates, (0,0)(0, 0)(0,0) (1,0)(1, 0)(1,0) \xe2\x80\xa6\\ldots\xe2\x80\xa6 (5.0)(5.0)(5.0) out of which (2,0)(2, 0)(2,0) and (3,0)(3,0)(3,0) are dirty.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq T \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa41080 \\leq L \\leq R \\leq  10^80\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4108\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq  10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\nExample Input\n4\n1 3 1\n6 9 3\n1 3 3\n6 9 4\n```### Example Output\n\n1 .\n9 ....#....\n3 ....\n-1\n### Explanation\n\n**Testcase $1$**:     \nGood numbers in range $[1,3]$ are $1$, $2$, $3$. $1^{st}$ of those is $1$. There is one way to reach $(0, 0)$ from $(0, 0)$.\n\n\n**Testcase $2$**:     \nGood numbers in range $[6,9]$ are $6$, $8$, $9$. $3^{rd}$ of those is $9$.\n\n\n**Testcase $4$**:     \nThere are only $3$ good numbers in range $[6,9]$.\n\n'
