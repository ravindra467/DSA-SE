b"Problem\nRead problems statements in Hindi,\nMandarin chinese\n, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef and his wife Chefina started playing a new game.\nAt the beginning of the game, Chefina secretly writes down a matrix AAA with NNN rows (numbered 111 through NNN) and NNN columns (numbered 111 through NNN). All elements of this matrix are distinct positive integers. Then, Chefina asks Chef to find the position (row and column) of the element with value VVV, or determine that such an element does not occur in AAA. Chef does not know the matrix AAA, but he can ask Chefina at most KKK questions about it. Each question must be in the format 1\xe2\x80\x89r\xe2\x80\x89c1\\, r\\, c1rc; Chefina answers Chef with the number Ar,cA_{r, c}Ar,c\xe2\x80\x8b.\nSince this task is really hard for Chef, Chefina decided to give him additional help \xe2\x80\x94 she told Chef that the matrix she writes down has a special property: each row and each column is sorted in some order (descending or ascending). Different rows and columns may be sorted in different order.\nChef may ask at most KKK questions in the format above. Afterwards, he must tell Chefina the position of the element VVV in the format 2\xe2\x80\x89i\xe2\x80\x89j2\\, i\\, j2ij, with the meaning that Ai,j=VA_{i, j} = VAi,j\xe2\x80\x8b=V if VVV occurs in AAA, or with i=j=\xe2\x88\x921i=j=-1i=j=\xe2\x88\x921 if VVV does not occur in AAA.\nThis is an interactive problem. You should play the game for Chef; the grader plays for Chefina.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers NNN, KKK and VVV.\nInteraction\nTo ask a question, print one line containing three space-separated integers 111, rrr and ccc to the output. Then, read the answer to this question from the input. The answer for an invalid question is \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921.\nYou may ask at most KKK questions. Don't forget to flush the output after printing each line!\nFinally, print the answer as one line containing three space-separated integers 222, iii and jjj.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le N \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,j\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\le A_{i, j} \\le 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,j\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid i,ji, ji,j\n1\xe2\x89\xa4V\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\le V \\le 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4V\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le N \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\nK=N\xe2\x8b\x85NK = N \\cdot NK=N\xe2\x8b\x85N\n\nSubtask #2 (20 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le N \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nK=11,000K = 11,000K=11,000\n\nSubtask #3 (30 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le N \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nK=6,000K = 6,000K=6,000\n\nSubtask #4 (40 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le N \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nK=4,000K = 4,000K=4,000\n\nExample Input\n3 10 4\n\nInteraction\nChef             Chefina\n1 1 1\n                 2\n1 1 2\n                 6\n1 2 1\n                 4\n2 2 1\n\nExplanation\nChefina wrote down a matrix with 333 columns and 333 rows.
