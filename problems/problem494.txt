b'Problem\n\nFind the nth term of a series for which if it is given that if n is less than 2 then the nth term is 1 and if n is greater than or equals to 2 and less than 4 nth term is 2 else nth term will be equal to the difference of (n+2)th term and (n-2)th term.\n\n tn = t(n+2) - t(n-2)   Where n \xe2\x89\xa5 4 \nThe answer could be very large, so compute it modulo with 109 + 7 \nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single integer N \n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the nth term of the series with modulo 109 + 7 \n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105 \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105 \n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n2\n5\nOutput:\n2\n3\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1.for n=2 , t2 = 2'
