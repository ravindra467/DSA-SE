There is a queue of NNN patients (numbered from patient 111 at the front of the queue to patient NNN at the back) outside his clinic. You, his assistant, found out that for each valid iii, the iii-th patient has an illness level AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b.\nChef treats patients based on their health, i.e. a patient with a higher illness level is always treated before any patients with a lower illness level. Chef is also fair, so he treats patients with an equal illness level based on their position in the queue, i.e. a patient ahead in the queue is always treated before a patient with the same illness level that is further behind in the queue.\nThe first patient to be treated has to wait an hour for Chef to set up his equipment. Treating each patient also takes an hour, and Chef always starts treating the next patient as soon as he is done with the current one.\nThe patients are a bit impatient. As Chef's assistant, for each patient, find out how long (in hours) this patient needs to wait before Chef starts treating this patient.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing NNN space-separated integers. For each valid iii, the iii-th of these integers should be the time the iii-th patient needs to wait.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa451 \\le T \\le 51\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le N \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le A_i \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa41,000 for each valid iii\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4\n5\n2 3 5 3 4\n3\n2 2 2\n6\n2 10 3 3 2 10\n4\n8 9 8 95 3 1 4 2\n1 2 3\n5 1 3 4 6 2\n3 1 4 2\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: Patient number 333 has the highest illness level. Therefore, this patient just waits an hour for Chef to set up his equipment and gets treated immediately after. Patient number 555 has the next highest illness level, so they go next. They need to wait an hour for patient 333 to be treated. In total, patient 555 has to wait 222 hours. After that, both patients 222 and 444 have an equal illness level, but patient 222 is ahead in the queue, so patient 222 goes next, followed by patient 444, and then finally patient 111.\nExample case 2: All three patients have the same illness level, so they are treated according to their position in the queue. Patient 111 goes first, followed by patient 222, and then patient 333.\nExample case 3: Patients at positions 222 and 666 in the queue have the highest illness level 101010. The patient at position 222 is ahead in the queue, so this patient is treated first, and then the patient at position 666 is treated. After this, the patients at positions 333 and 444 in the queue have the next highest illness level, so the patient at position 333 is treated next, followed by the patient at position 444. Similarly, afterwards, the patient at position 111 is treated, and then the patient at position 555 is treated.\nExample case 4: Patients at positions 222 and 444 in the queue have the highest illness level 999, so the patient at position 222 is treated first, followed by the patient at position 444, then the patient at position 111 and finally the patient at position 333."
