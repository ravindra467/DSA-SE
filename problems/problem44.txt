b"Problem\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.\nChef likes to solve difficult tasks. This time, he tried to solve the Big Famous Unsolvable A+B=CA+B=CA+B=C. One of his friends played a prank on Chef and randomly shuffled the bits in AAA and BBB (independently in each number). However, the funny thing is that the sum of the resulting numbers remained CCC even after shuffling.\nChef is now wondering: in how many ways is it possible to shuffle the bits of AAA and the bits of BBB such that their sum after shuffling is equal to CCC? Let's denote the integers obtained by shuffling the bits of AAA and BBB by AsA_sAs\xe2\x80\x8b and BsB_sBs\xe2\x80\x8b respectively; two ways (As1,Bs1)(A_{s1}, B_{s1})(As1\xe2\x80\x8b,Bs1\xe2\x80\x8b) and (As2,Bs2)(A_{s2}, B_{s2})(As2\xe2\x80\x8b,Bs2\xe2\x80\x8b) are considered distinct if As1\xe2\x89\xa0As2A_{s1} \\neq A_{s2}As1\xe2\x80\x8b\xee\x80\xa0=As2\xe2\x80\x8b or Bs1\xe2\x89\xa0Bs2B_{s1} \\neq B_{s2}Bs1\xe2\x80\x8b\xee\x80\xa0=Bs2\xe2\x80\x8b.\nIt is allowed to add any number (possibly zero) of leading zeroes, i.e. bits 000, to AAA and any number of leading zeroes to BBB before shuffling the bits.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers AAA, BBB and CCC.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of ways to shuffle the bits.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le T \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A,B,C\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\le A, B, C \\le 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4A,B,C\xe2\x89\xa4109\nA+B=CA+B = CA+B=C\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4A,B,C\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le A, B, C \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4A,B,C\xe2\x89\xa4105\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints\nExample Input\n2\n1 2 3\n369 428 797\n\nExample Output\n2\n56\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: We can consider A=01A=01A=01 and B=10B=10B=10 in binary. Then, there are two possible ways: swapping the two bits of AAA and the two bits of BBB (As=10A_s=10As\xe2\x80\x8b=10, Bs=01B_s=01Bs\xe2\x80\x8b=01 in binary, 222 and 111 in decimal representation) or not shuffling any bits."
