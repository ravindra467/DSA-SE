b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Mandarin Chinese and Bengali.\nThere are NNN positions in a queue. Given a binary string SSS of length NNN, where Si=S_i =Si\xe2\x80\x8b= \'$1$\' denotes, there is a person standing in the ithi^{th}ith position.\nThe distance between two people standing in the ithi^{th}ith and jthj^{th}jth positions respectively in the queue is \xe2\x88\xa3i\xe2\x88\x92j\xe2\x88\xa3\\mid i - j \\mid\xe2\x88\xa3i\xe2\x88\x92j\xe2\x88\xa3, where \xe2\x88\xa3x\xe2\x88\xa3\\mid x \\mid\xe2\x88\xa3x\xe2\x88\xa3 denotes the absolute value of xxx. Now, two people are considered to be friends if they are at a distance less than or equal to KKK.\nLet\'s say, there are MMM people, P1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PMP_1, P_2, \\dots, P_MP1\xe2\x80\x8b,P2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,PM\xe2\x80\x8b standing one after another in a queue such that for each 1\xe2\x89\xa4i<M1 \\leq i \\lt M1\xe2\x89\xa4i<M, PiP_iPi\xe2\x80\x8b and Pi+1P_{i+1}Pi+1\xe2\x80\x8b are friends, then all the MMM people are considered to be in a friend group.\nFor example, consider the string S=S =S= "$1101001$" and K=2K = 2K=2.\nLet\'s denote the people standing in the 1st1^{st}1st, 2nd2^{nd}2nd, 4th4^{th}4th and 7th7^{th}7th positions in the queue by P1,P2,P3,P4P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4P1\xe2\x80\x8b,P2\xe2\x80\x8b,P3\xe2\x80\x8b,P4\xe2\x80\x8b respectively. Now, P1P_1P1\xe2\x80\x8b and P2P_2P2\xe2\x80\x8b are friends as the distance between them is 111, P2P_2P2\xe2\x80\x8b and P3P_3P3\xe2\x80\x8b are also friends as the distance between them is 222. P4P_4P4\xe2\x80\x8b is not friend with anyone. Hence P1,P2,P3P_1, P_2, P_3P1\xe2\x80\x8b,P2\xe2\x80\x8b,P3\xe2\x80\x8b form a friend group and P4P_4P4\xe2\x80\x8b forms a separate friend group.\nNow each person can move one position right or one position left or stay in the same position. However, they can\'t move out of the queue. Find the minimum number of friend groups they can form if they move optimally.\nIt is possible that there is more than one person standing in the same position after the movements.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers N,KN, KN,K.\nThe second line of each test case contains a string SSS.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the minimum number of friend groups.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851041 \\leq T \\leq 5\\cdot10^41\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N0 \\leq K \\leq N0\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\nSSS contains only characters \'000` and \'111\'\nThe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 10610^6106.\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n6 2\n010010\n4 0\n1001\n7 2\n1101001\n1\n2\n1\nExplanation:\n\n\nTest case 111: If the person standing in the 5th5^{th}5th position moves one position left, the distance between the two people becomes 222 which is equal to KKK. So they form a friend group.\n\n\nTest case 222: If the person standing in the 1st1^{st}1st position moves one position right and the person standing in the 4th4^{th}4th position moves one position left, the string becomes "011001100110", still the distance between them is greater than K=0K = 0K=0. So they form two separate friend groups.\n\n\nTest case 333: Initially first three people form a friend group and the fourth person forms a separate friend group. Now if the fourth person moves one position left, he becomes a friend of the third person as the distance between these two people is equal to 222, and hence all the four people belong to one friend group.\n\n'
