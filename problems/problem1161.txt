b'Problem\nCooper is trying to decipher the strange dust patterns in Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s room.\nHe observes that there are two patterns repeating, and he decides to write them as binary strings having \xe2\x80\x98a\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98b\xe2\x80\x99. He now obtains two strings of equal length NNN, where NNN is even. Now to process this, he needs to make both the strings palindromic, which he wants you to do. He thus gives you the strings.\nYou are given two strings of equal length NNN, where NNN is even. Every character in each string has only two possible characters, \xe2\x80\x98a\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98b\xe2\x80\x99.\nYou have at most N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 operations of the form x0x_0x0\xe2\x80\x8b x1x_1x1\xe2\x80\x8b x2x_2x2\xe2\x80\x8b. This means:\n\nIf x0=1x_0=1x0\xe2\x80\x8b=1, swap the x1thx_1^{th}x1th\xe2\x80\x8b and x2thx_2^{th}x2th\xe2\x80\x8b characters of string 1.\nIf x0=2x_0=2x0\xe2\x80\x8b=2, swap the x1thx_1^{th}x1th\xe2\x80\x8b character of string 1 and x2thx_2^{th}x2th\xe2\x80\x8b character of string 2.\nIf x0=3x_0=3x0\xe2\x80\x8b=3, swap the x1thx_1^{th}x1th\xe2\x80\x8b and x2thx_2^{th}x2th\xe2\x80\x8b character of string 2.\n\nFor example if the operation is 111 555 444, swap the 5th character of string 1 and the 4th character of string 1.\nYou either have to use these operations to make both the strings palindromic or report that such a transformation is not possible and conclude that the strange dust pattern did not mean anything.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of the input contains TTT, the number of test cases.\nIn each test case, the first line has NNN, the number of letters in each string.\nThe next two lines contain the two strings.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq T \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4502 \\leq N \\leq 502\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa450, NNN is even\n\nOutput Format\n\nFor each test case, print several lines.\nIf the transformation is not possible, print a line containing -1.\nElse, print on the first line the number of needed operations.\nIn each of the next lines, print a sequence of integers x0x_0x0\xe2\x80\x8b x1x_1x1\xe2\x80\x8b x2x_2x2\xe2\x80\x8b.\nNote that you do not have to minimize the number of operations.\nIf there are multiple solutions, you may print any.\n\nSample Input\n2\r\n6\r\naabaaa\r\nbaabba\r\n6\r\naaaaaa\r\nbbbbba\n\nSample Output\n2\r\n2 4 1\r\n3 5 3\r\n-1\n'
