b'Problem\n\nEastern Draughts is played on an NxN grid,\nconsisting of cells (x, y) with 0 \xe2\x89\xa4 x,y < N.\nSome cells of the grid have pieces on them, and no cell may ever have more than one piece at a time.\nThe number of pieces will be equal to P*(P+1)/2 for some positive integer P \xe2\x89\xa4 N.\nThere are two types of moves in the game:\n\n\nA step consists of moving a piece from (x, y) to (x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), (x, y-1), (x+1, y-1), or (x-1, y+1).\nThe destination cell must be empty, and must lie within the bounds of the grid.\nNote that you cannot move a piece directly from (x, y) to (x-1, y-1) or (x+1, y+1).\n\n\nA jump consists of moving a piece from (x, y) to (x+2, y), (x-2, y), (x, y+2), (x, y-2), (x+2, y-2), or (x-2, y+2).\nNot only must the destination cell be empty and lie within the bounds of the grid,\nbut the cell between the source and destination cells must contain a piece.\n\n\n\n\nA turn consists of either a single step, or a sequence of one or more jumps where the same piece is moved with each jump.\nThe goal is to move the pieces to the goal configuration in as few turns as possible.\nThe goal configuration is such that each cell (x, y) contains a piece if and only if x+y < P.\n\n\nFor this problem, you do not need to use as few turns as possible, but the fewer turns you use the higher your score will be.\n\nInput\n\nInput will begin with an integer N, the size of the grid.\nN lines follow with N characters each, giving the initial positions of the pieces.\nA \'*\' indicates a piece, and a \'.\' indicates an empty cell.\nThe upper-left corner is (0, 0), upper-right corner is (N-1, 0), bottom-left corner is (0, N-1), and bottom-right corner (N-1, N-1).\n\nOutput\n\nFirst output an integer L,\nthe number of moves in your solution (not number of turns).\nThen output L lines, each formatted as "x1 y1 x2 y2", where (x1, y1) is the source cell and (x2, y2) is the destination cell.  L must be less than one million.\n\nScoring\n\nLet K be the number of turns in your solution, and let S be the sum of x+y over all\ncells initially containing pieces, and R be the sum of x+y over all cells containing pieces in the goal configuration.\nThen your score for each test case is (S - R)/K.\nYour overall score is the average of your scores on the individual input files.\n\nSample Input 1\n4\n....\n....\n....\n..*.\n\nSample Output\n5\n2 3 2 2\n2 2 2 1\n2 1 2 0\n2 0 1 0\n1 0 0 0\n\nSample Input 2\n5\n.....\n...*.\n...*.\n.....\n..*..\n\nSample Output 2\n10\n2 4 2 3\n2 3 4 1\n4 1 2 1\n3 2 3 0\n3 1 1 1\n3 0 1 2\n1 2 1 0\n2 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n1 1 0 1\n\nThe sample output uses 5 turns on the first test case, and 8 on the second.\nThe sequence of turns on the second test case is:\n(2 4) - (2 3)\n(2 3) - (4 1) - (2 1)\n(3 2) - (3 0)\n(3 1) - (1 1)\n(3 0) - (1 2) - (1 0)\n(2 1) - (0 1)\n(0 1) - (0 0)\n(1 1) - (0 1)\n\nFor the first test case S = 5 and R = 0, and for the second case S = 15 and R = 2.\nThus the score for the first test case is (5 - 0)/5 = 1, and the score for the second test case is (15 - 2)/8 = 1.625.\nThe overall score is (1 + 1.625)/2 = 1.3125.\n\nTest Case Generation\nN is chosen randomly and uniformly between 10 and 30, inclusive.  P is chosen randomly and uniformly between 1 and N, inclusive.  P*(P+1)/2 cells are chosen at random for pieces.  You may safely assume there will be no test cases where the starting configuration is equal to the goal configuration.'
