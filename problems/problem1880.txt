b"Problem\nSherlock has finally caught Jim Moriarty in his own trap. Jim had called Sherlock to the amusement park to play one of his mind games, but he wasn't aware that the Sherlock had beforehand bugged the whole place with his newly invented device, which tells Sherlock the chances of Moriarty being at a particular place in the park.\nThe design of the Amusement park if plotted on a graph is in the form of a tree having no self-loops or multiple edges of NNN vertices and rooted at index 111. Sherlock's device returns an array of length NNN consisting of integers. The Higher the value of integer at ithithith index the higher is the probability of Moriarty being at Vertex iii. Let the array be denoted by KKK.\nSherlock knows that Jim Moriarty is no fool and he can't just go to each vertex in search of Moriarity as he might run away. He devises a plan of selecting a subset of the nodes in the tree and visiting all vertices of the subset. He wants to select nodes for the subset such that he has the highest chance of catching Moriarty without alerting him. For not alerting Moriarty he says that if he visits a vertex iii he would not visit next JJJ levels directly below the vertex iii.\nJJJ is calculated by taking the xor(\xe2\x8a\x95)xor( \xe2\x8a\x95 )xor(\xe2\x8a\x95) of all the values K[a]K[a]K[a] where aaa denotes the index of all the selected ancestors of iii and iii as well.\nlet's say sherlock selected some vertices from the tree by keeping the above condition in mind, then the total value of the subset would be  \xe2\x88\x91K[v]\xe2\x88\x91 K[v]\xe2\x88\x91K[v] where vvv denotes all the selected vertices.\nYou know Sherlock is Damn smart and he can find the optimal subset without your help, but for that, Sherlock would have to use his special medicines(You know what I mean) to check all the valid Combinations and chose the best subset of vertices. But as he has promised his friend Dr Watson of not taking these drugs(oops I said that) ever again, he has asked for your help.\nHelp Sherlock maximise the total value.\nMISSMISSMISS ME!!!!ME!!!!ME!!!!\nNoteNoteNote-\n1.)1.)1.) if iii node is chosen and no ancestors of iii are part of the subset of selected vertices, then the value of JJJ at node iii will be just K[i]K[i]K[i].\n2.)2.)2.) the subset of selected vertices should follow Sherlock's strategy, i.e no node should be present in the subset which violates the given condition.\nInput:\n\n\nFirst line will contain an integer NNN denoting the no. of vertices in the tree.\n\n\nSecond line will contain an array KKK of length NNN containing the values returned by the special device. Then N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 lines follow denoting the Connections in the Tree.\n\n\nEach line consists of a single line of input, two integers X,YX, YX,Y, denoting a connection between VVVXXX and VVVYYY.\n\n\nOutput:\nOutput a single line containing the maximum possible sum by selecting some/all(if possible) vertices from the tree keeping the above conditions in mind.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq N \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4K[i]\xe2\x89\xa410230 \\leq K[i] \\leq 10230\xe2\x89\xa4K[i]\xe2\x89\xa41023 wherewherewhere K[i]K[i]K[i] denotesdenotesdenotes thethethe valuevaluevalue atatat vertexvertexvertex iii\n\nSample Input:\n8\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n3 5\n3 6\n4 7\n4 8\nSample Output:\n7\n### EXPLANATION:\n\nIf we select vertices 2,5,6,7,82,5,6,7,82,5,6,7,8 then we get a total of 5. See that the given set does not violate the required condition.\nIf we select vertices 1,3,4,5,6,7,81,3,4,5,6,7,81,3,4,5,6,7,8 then we get a total of 7. See that even this set does not violate the required condition. the J in this case for vertex 1=1 , vertex 3= 0(1 xor 1),\nvertex 4=0(1xor1)\nVertex 3 and vertex 4 have J=0 because 1 is their ancestor.\nSo the maximum answer is 7."
