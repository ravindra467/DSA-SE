b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef likes tournament graphs, which are directed graphs where each unordered pair of vertices is directly connected by exactly one edge. A directed graph is strongly connected if for each pair of vertices (a,b)(a, b)(a,b), there is a path from the vertex aaa to the vertex bbb.\nConsider a tournament graph GGG with NNN vertices (numbered 111 through NNN). Chef takes a sequence of pairs of vertices (a1,b1),(a2,b2),\xe2\x80\xa6,(aM,bM)(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \\ldots, (a_M, b_M)(a1\xe2\x80\x8b,b1\xe2\x80\x8b),(a2\xe2\x80\x8b,b2\xe2\x80\x8b),\xe2\x80\xa6,(aM\xe2\x80\x8b,bM\xe2\x80\x8b) and does the following for each iii from 111 to MMM in this order:\n\nFlip the direction of the edge between vertices aia_iai\xe2\x80\x8b and bib_ibi\xe2\x80\x8b.\nIf the graph is strongly connected either before or after flipping this edge, declare GGG a bad tournament.\n\nIf GGG is never declared a bad tournament, Chef calls it a good tournament. Given the sequence of MMM edge flips, find a good tournament.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and MMM.\nMMM lines follow. For each valid iii, the iii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers aia_iai\xe2\x80\x8b and bib_ibi\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 lines. For each valid iii, the iii-th of these lines should contain N\xe2\x88\x92iN-iN\xe2\x88\x92i space-separated integers; for each valid jjj, the jjj-th of these integers should be 111 if there is an edge from the vertex iii to the vertex i+ji+ji+j or 000 if there is an edge from the vertex i+ji+ji+j to the vertex iii.\nIt can be proved that a good tournament always exists under the given constraints. If there are multiple solutions, you may print any one of them.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa44001 \\le T \\le 4001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4400\n6\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa44006 \\le N \\le 4006\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4400\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 4,0004,0004,000\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): M=N\xe2\x88\x922M = N-2M=N\xe2\x88\x922\nSubtask #2 (40 points): M=\xe2\x8c\x883N2\xe2\x8c\x89\xe2\x88\x923M = \\left\\lceil\\frac{3N}{2}\\right\\rceil - 3M=\xe2\x8c\x8823N\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x8c\x89\xe2\x88\x923\nSubtask #3 (30 points): M=2N\xe2\x88\x9211M = 2N-11M=2N\xe2\x88\x9211\nExample Input\n1\r\n6 4\r\n1 3\r\n3 4\r\n2 6\r\n5 6\n\nExample Output\n1 0 1 1 1\r\n0 0 0 1\r\n1 1 1\r\n1 1\r\n0\n'
