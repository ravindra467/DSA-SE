b'Problem\nYou are given a string sss, of length nnn. You have to output all the sub-sequences of sss, with length exactly equal to nnn, in increasing order, each in a new line.\nA subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\nFor ex.: abcabcabc is a sub-sequence of abdcabdcabdc, while acbacbacb is not.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain nnn, the length of the string.\nSecond line will contain the string sss.\n\nOutput:\nFor the given string sss, print all the sub-sequences of sss, with length exactly equal to nnn.\nConstraints:\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\leq n \\leq 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4106\nsss only contains Lower-Case English Alphabets.\n\nSample Input:\n3\r\nhey\n\nSample Output:\nhey\n'
