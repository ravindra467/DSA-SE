b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Mandarin, Vietnamese, and Russian as well.\nYou are given a positive integer KKK and an array AAA consisting of NNN non-negative integers. Find the lexicographically smallest sequence BBB that satisfies the following conditions\n\nWe can obtain BBB by rearranging the elements in AAA.\nThe length of longest non-decreasing subsequence of BBB is equal to KKK.\n\nIf no such sequence exists, print \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921.\nInput Format\n\nFirst line of the input contains TTT, the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nFirst line of each test case contains two space separated integers NNN and KKK.\nSecond line of each test case contains NNN space separated integers describing the array AAA.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output the array BBB in a single line with a space between two consecutive elements. And output \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 if no such array BBB exists.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42001 \\leq T \\leq 2001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4200\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42001 \\leq N \\leq 2001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4200\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq K \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq A_i \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4N\nSum of NNN over all test cases doesn't exceed 200200200.\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4\n3 1\n2 1 3\n3 2\n2 1 3\n3 3\n2 1 3\n3 1\n2 2 3\n3 2 1\n1 3 2\n1 2 3\n-1\n\nExplanation:\nThere are 666 arrays that are rearrangements of the array [2,1,3][2, 1, 3][2,1,3].\n\n[1,2,3][1, 2, 3][1,2,3] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 333.\n[1,3,2][1, 3, 2][1,3,2] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 222.\n[2,1,3][2, 1, 3][2,1,3] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 222.\n[2,3,1][2, 3, 1][2,3,1] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 222.\n[3,1,2][3, 1, 2][3,1,2] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 222.\n[3,2,1][3, 2, 1][3,2,1] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 111.\n\nTest case 1:\nObserve from the list above that [3,2,1][3, 2, 1][3,2,1] is the only rearrangement of [2,1,3][2, 1, 3][2,1,3] with the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 111. And hence [3,2,1][3, 2, 1][3,2,1] is the lexicographically smallest that satisfies the given conditions.\nTest case 2:\nObserve from the above list the [1,3,2][1, 3, 2][1,3,2] is the lexicographically smallest among all those rearrangements with the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 222. And hence [1,3,2][1, 3, 2][1,3,2] is the lexicographically smallest that satisfies the given conditions.\nTest case 3:\nObserve from the list above that [1,2,3][1, 2, 3][1,2,3] is the only rearrangement of [2,1,3][2, 1, 3][2,1,3] with the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 333. And hence [1,2,3][1, 2, 3][1,2,3] is the lexicographically smallest that satisfies the given conditions.\nTest case 4:\nThere are only 333 possible ways to rearrange [2,2,3][2, 2, 3][2,2,3].\n\n[2,2,3][2, 2, 3][2,2,3] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 333.\n[2,3,2][2, 3, 2][2,3,2] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 222.\n[3,2,2][3, 2, 2][3,2,2] with length of longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 222.\n\nSo there does not exist any rearrangement of [2,2,3][2, 2, 3][2,2,3] with the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence equal to 111."
