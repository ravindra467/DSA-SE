b'Problem\nYou are given a MMM x MMM grid representing a city. A cell in this grid is represented as (i,j)(i,j)(i,j), i.e. the cell at the iii-th row and jjj-th column in the grid. You own two trucks AAA and BBB that deliver goods. Truck AAA is located at at (Ax,Ay)(Ax, Ay)(Ax,Ay) and Truck BBB is located at (Bx,By)(Bx, By)(Bx,By). Both trucks have an infinite number of goods. The two trucks could initially be at the same location.\nThe distance to travel between cells (i1,j1)(i_1, j_1)(i1\xe2\x80\x8b,j1\xe2\x80\x8b) and (i2,j2)(i_2, j_2)(i2\xe2\x80\x8b,j2\xe2\x80\x8b) is the Manhattan Distance, i.e.,  \xe2\x88\xa3i1\xe2\x88\x92i2\xe2\x88\xa3+\xe2\x88\xa3j1\xe2\x88\x92j2\xe2\x88\xa3|i_1-i_2| + |j_1-j_2|\xe2\x88\xa3i1\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\x92i2\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\xa3+\xe2\x88\xa3j1\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\x92j2\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\xa3 units.\nYour company has to serve NNN orders, where the iii-th order is located at position (xi,yi)(x_i, y_i)(xi\xe2\x80\x8b,yi\xe2\x80\x8b). An order is said to be served if some truck moves to the location of the iii-th order. Additionally, the iii-th order can be served only once all order numbers from 1 to i\xe2\x88\x921i-1i\xe2\x88\x921 have been served.\nWhat is the minimum total distance that the trucks must travel to serve all NNN orders?\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain NNN, the number of orders to serve.\nThe next line contains 2 space separated integers, Ax,AyAx, AyAx,Ay, the co-ordinates of truck A\nThe next line contains 2 space separated integers, Bx,ByBx, ByBx,By, the co-ordinates of truck B\nNNN lines lines follow, iii-th of which contains 2 space separated integers, (xi,yi)(x_i, y_i)(xi\xe2\x80\x8b,yi\xe2\x80\x8b), the location of the iii-th order.\n\nOutput:\nPrint a single integer, denoting the minimum total distance travelled by the trucks.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa450001 \\leq N \\leq 50001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ax,Ay,Bx,By,xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq A_x, A_y, B_x, B_y, x_i, y_i \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Ax\xe2\x80\x8b,Ay\xe2\x80\x8b,Bx\xe2\x80\x8b,By\xe2\x80\x8b,xi\xe2\x80\x8b,yi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSubtasks\n\n30 points : 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq N \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100 and 1\xe2\x89\xa4Ax,Ay,Bx,By,xi,yi,\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq A_x, A_y, B_x, B_y, x_i, y_i, \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4Ax\xe2\x80\x8b,Ay\xe2\x80\x8b,Bx\xe2\x80\x8b,By\xe2\x80\x8b,xi\xe2\x80\x8b,yi\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x89\xa4100\n70 points : original constraints\n\nSample Input:\n3\n3 2\n4 2\n2 1\n2 4\n2 1\nSample Output:\n6\n### EXPLANATION:\nTruck A serves orders 1 and 3 while truck B serves order number 2. Total distance covered by A is 2 units and by B is 4 units. The total distance covered by both trucks combined is 6 units and this is optimal.\nOne should keep in mind that order number 3 is not served instantly when truck A arrives at location (2,1)(2,1)(2,1). Instead it is served only after both orders 1 and 2 have been served.'
