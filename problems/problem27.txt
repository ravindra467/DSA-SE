b'Problem\nAujasvit just came up with a new game to play with his friends. NNN people stand in a circle, each assigned an index from 111 to NNN in clockwise order. Then the following operation is done N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 times.\n\nThe person with the lowest index holds a coin.\nThen, the coin then moves to the next person clockwise M\xe2\x88\x921M-1M\xe2\x88\x921 times.\nThen, the person who is holding the coin is removed from the circle.\n\nThe last person remaining after N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 operations is the winner.\nAujasvit has already decided on the integer MMM to be used in the game. Before inviting people to play his game, Aujasvit wants to know the winner if the game has 111 player, 222 players, 333 players, ..., XXX players. That is, you need to output the winner when N=1,N=2,...,N=XN = 1, N = 2, ..., N = XN=1,N=2,...,N=X.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of each input contains TTT - the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.\nThe only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers MMM and XXX.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each testcase, output XXX integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AXA_1, A_2, \\dots, A_XA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AX\xe2\x80\x8b, where AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b is the index of the winner if iii people are playing this game.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq T \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq M \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4100001 \\leq X \\leq 100001\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa410000\nSum of XXX over all testcases is not more than 5\xe2\x8b\x851055 \\cdot 10^55\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n2 3\n1 1 1\nExplanation:\n\nTest case 111:\n\nWhen there is only 111 player, they are the winner. Therefore player 111 wins.\nWhen there are 222 players, player 222 is removed in the first round. Therefore player 111 wins.\nWhen there are 333 players, player 222 is removed in the first round, and player 333 is removed in the second round. Therefore player 111 wins.\n\n\n'
