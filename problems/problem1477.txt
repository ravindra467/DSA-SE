b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a graph GGG with NNN vertices (numbered 111 through NNN) and MMM edges. You should partition the vertices of GGG into two sets AAA and BBB such that:\n\neach vertex of GGG belongs to exactly one of these sets\nAAA is non-empty\nAAA is an independent set in GGG, i.e. for each pair of vertices u,v\xe2\x88\x88Au, v \\in Au,v\xe2\x88\x88A, GGG does not contain an edge (u,v)(u, v)(u,v)\nfor each vertex a\xe2\x88\x88Aa \\in Aa\xe2\x88\x88A and each vertex b\xe2\x88\x88Bb \\in Bb\xe2\x88\x88B, there is an edge (a,b)(a, b)(a,b) in GGG\n\nFind the number of such partitions (A,B)(A, B)(A,B). Also, give an example of one of these partitions or determine that no such partition exists.\nTwo partitions are considered different if there is a vertex that is in the set AAA in one partition and in the set BBB in the other partition.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and MMM.\nEach of the next MMM lines contains two space-separated integers uuu and vvv denoting that vertices uuu and vvv are connected by an edge.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print two lines.\n\nThe first of these lines should contain a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of partitions satisfying the given conditions.\nThe second line should contain a single string with length NNN. If there are no partitions satisfying the given conditions, each character of this string should be '0'. Otherwise, this string should describe one such partition \xe2\x80\x94 for each valid iii, the iii-th character should be '1' if vertex iii belongs to AAA or '0' if it belongs to BBB.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851051 \\leq T \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851051 \\leq N, M \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le u, v \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\nthere are no self-loops or duplicate edges in the graph\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x851055 \\cdot 10^55\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of MMM over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x851055 \\cdot 10^55\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): N,M,T\xe2\x89\xa4100N,M,T \\leq 100N,M,T\xe2\x89\xa4100\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n5 7\n1 3\n1 4\n1 5\n2 3\n2 4\n2 5\n3 41\n11000\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: The only possible partition satisfying the given conditions is A={1,2},B={3,4,5}A = \\{1, 2\\}, B = \\{3, 4, 5\\}A={1,2},B={3,4,5}."
