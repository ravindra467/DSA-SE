b"Problem\nAfter the death of their mother, Alphonse and Edward now live with Pinako and Winry.\nPinako is worried about their obsession with Alchemy, and that they don't give attention to their studies.\nSo to improve their mathematical solving ability, every day she gives a mathematical problem to solve. They can go out to practice Alchemy only after they have solved the problem.\r\nHelp them by solving the given problem, so that they can go early today for their Alchemy practice.\nGiven an array AAA of NNN non-negative integers and two integers KKK and MMM. Find the number of subsequences of array AAA of length KKK which satisfies the following property:\nSuppose the subsequence is S=S1S2\xe2\x80\xa6SKS = S_1S_2 \\ldots S_KS=S1\xe2\x80\x8bS2\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\xa6SK\xe2\x80\x8b, then for all iii such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4K1 \\leq i \\leq K1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4K,\nSi%M=i%MS_i \\% M = i \\% MSi\xe2\x80\x8b%M=i%M\r\nshould hold true, where SiS_iSi\xe2\x80\x8b denotes the iii-th element of the subsequence, using 1-based indexing.\nAs the number of subsequences may be very large, output the answer modulo 100000000710000000071000000007.\nPS: We also proposed the idea of making a look-alike clone through alchemy and keeping it in front of the study table. But it seems impossible to convince Edward to make a clone of his exact same height, and not taller than him. So solving the problem for him was a better choice.\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains TTT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nFor every test case, the first line contains NNN, KKK and MMM.\nFor every test case, the second line contains NNN integers AiA_{i}Ai\xe2\x80\x8b ( 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq i \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N).\n\nOutput:\nFor every test case, output in a single line an integer denoting the number of valid subsequences modulo 109+710^9+7109+7\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq T \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\leq N \\leq 10^{4}1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq K \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\n\xe2\x8c\x88K100\xe2\x8c\x89\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4100\xc3\x97K\\lceil \\frac{K}{100}\\rceil \\leq M \\leq  100\\times K\xe2\x8c\x88100K\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x8c\x89\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4100\xc3\x97K\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41090 \\leq A_{i} \\leq 10^{9}0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSample Input:\n1\r\n12 4 3\r\n4 5 6 7 1 4 6 9 0 0 10 2\n\nSample Output:\n8\n\nExplanation:\nThe subsequences of length 444, satisfying the given criteria are [4,5,6,7][4, 5, 6, 7][4,5,6,7], [4,5,6,10][4, 5, 6, 10][4,5,6,10], [4,5,6,10][4, 5, 6, 10][4,5,6,10], [4,5,6,1][4, 5, 6, 1][4,5,6,1], [4,5,9,10][4, 5, 9, 10][4,5,9,10] ,[4,5,6,4][4, 5, 6, 4][4,5,6,4] , [4,5,0,10][4, 5, 0, 10][4,5,0,10] and [4,5,0,10][4, 5, 0, 10][4,5,0,10]. This accounts for a total of 888 valid subsequences.\nLet us take one subsequence and see why it satisfies the given property. Consider [4,5,9,10][4, 5, 9, 10][4,5,9,10].\n\nS1%M=4%3=1=1%3=1%MS_1 \\% M = 4 \\% 3 = 1 = 1 \\% 3 = 1 \\% MS1\xe2\x80\x8b%M=4%3=1=1%3=1%M\nS2%M=5%3=2=2%3=2%MS_2 \\% M = 5 \\% 3 = 2 = 2 \\% 3 = 2 \\% MS2\xe2\x80\x8b%M=5%3=2=2%3=2%M\nS3%M=9%3=0=3%3=3%MS_3 \\% M = 9 \\% 3 = 0 = 3 \\% 3 = 3 \\% MS3\xe2\x80\x8b%M=9%3=0=3%3=3%M\nS4%M=10%3=1=4%3=4%MS_4 \\% M = 10 \\% 3 = 1 = 4 \\% 3 = 4 \\% MS4\xe2\x80\x8b%M=10%3=1=4%3=4%M\n\nAll the valid iii satisfy the condition, and hence this is a valid subsequence."
