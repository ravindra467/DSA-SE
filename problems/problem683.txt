b'Problem\n\xc2\xa0\nMathematics Teacher asked Sam to look after the class for a while and do not let anyone leave the class as "CR Nandu" is absent.Teacher is taking a lot of time into his work and students are getting impatient.So Sam  allows students to go one by one out of class to get refreshed.But students are not listening to Sam  and going in and out from the class.\nSo Sam  started noticing the Roll Numbers of Students crossing the door.After a while when teacher came he noticed that one of the student is missing.So he asks Sam  for the missing student.\nHelp Sam  to solve this problem so that he can answer which student is missing.\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\n\nThe first line contains T i.e. the number of test cases.\n.\nT test case where each follow, an integer N and next  line containing  space seperated N roll numbers,\n\nOutput\n\nFor each testcase, print  the Student number.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10^9\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 10^15\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 a \xe2\x89\xa4 10^15\n\nExample\nInput:\n1\n6\n10 15 15 20 10 \nOutput:\n20\n\n\nSolution# include<stdio.h>\nint main()\n{\nfloat t;\nscanf("% d",&t);\nwhile(t--)\n{\nlong  int a[100000],n,s=1,i;\nscanf("%lld",&t);\nfor(i=0;i<n;i++)\n{\nscanf(" %lld ",&a);\n}\nfor(i=0;i&lt;n;j++)\n{\ns+=j*i;\n}\nprintf("%lld\\n",s);\n\n}\nreturn 0;\n}\n\n\nSteps to be followed\n    1. Read the given description carefully and understand the problem.\n2. Analyze the code given in the problem and find bugs(errors) in these codes..<br><br>\n\n3. The given code can be copied and compiled in an online compiler (Eg. ideone.com).<br><br>\n\n4. Once the bugs are eliminated from the code, the clean code can be submitted as the solution to the problem..<br><br>\n\n5. The solution should be a debugged version of the code provided and must satisfy the test cases to be accepted..<br><br>\n\nAll the best!!'
