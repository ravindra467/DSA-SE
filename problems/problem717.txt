b"Problem\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef likes to mix colors a lot. Recently, she was gifted N colors A1, A2, ..., AN by her friend.\nChef wants to make the values of all her colors pairwise distinct, as they will then look stunningly beautiful. In order to achieve that, she can perform the following mixing operation zero or more times:\n\nChoose any two colors. Let's denote their values by x and y.\nMix the color with value x into the color with value y. After the mixing, the value of the first color remains x, but the value of the second color changes to x + y.\n\n\nFind the minimum number of mixing operations Chef needs to perform to make her colors beautiful.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of colors.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting Chef's initial colors.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of required mixing operations.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 109 for each valid i\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n3\n1 2 3\n3\n2 1 20\n1\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: No two colors have the same value. Hence, they are already beautiful. No mixing is required.\nExample case 2: Take the second color (with value x = 1) and mix it into the first color (with value x = 2). After the mixing, the colors will be 3 1 2. Now the colors are beautiful. This is the minimum number of mixing operations that are required. Hence, the answer is 1."
