b"Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese , Russian and Vietnamese as well.\n\nYou are given a binary string S of N bits. The bits in the string are indexed starting from 1. S[i] denotes the ith bit of S.\n\n\nLet's say that a sequence i1, i2, \xe2\x80\xa6, iK(1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K; 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i1 < i2 < \xe2\x80\xa6 < iK \xe2\x89\xa4 N) produces a palindrome when applied to S, if the string S[i1] S[i2] \xe2\x80\xa6 S[ik] is a palindrome (that is, reads the same backward or forward).\n\n \nIn addition, a sequence i1, i2, \xe2\x80\xa6, iK(1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K; 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i1 < i2 < \xe2\x80\xa6 < iK \xe2\x89\xa4 N) is said to be exponential, if ij + 1 = p * ij for each integer 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 j < K and for some integer p > 1. Note, that a sequence of one element is always exponential.\n\nYour task is to count the number of exponential sequences that produce a palindrome when applied to S.\nInput\nThe first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\n\nThe only line of description for each test case contains a binary string S of N bits.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the number of exponential sequences that produce a palindrome.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\nSubtask 1(20 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 20\nSubtask 2(30 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\nSubtask 3(50 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 5 \xc3\x97 105\n\nNote\n\nThe first test of the first subtask is the example test. It's made for you to make sure that your solution produces the same verdict both on your machine and our server.\n\nTime Limits\n\nTime limit for the first and the second subtasks is 3s. Time limit for the third subtask is 6s.\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n11010\n1010010119\n18"
