b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nA directed tree is a directed graph such that if all edges were undirected, this graph would be a tree. A rooted directed tree is a directed tree in which there is one vertex (the root, let's denote it by rrr) such that it is possible to reach all vertices of the graph from rrr by moving along the directed edges.\nYou are given a directed tree with NNN vertices (numbered 111 through NNN). You may perform the following operation on it any number of times (including zero):\n\nChoose some edge which currently exists in the graph.\nRemove this edge.\nAdd a new edge in such a way that the graph becomes a directed tree again.\n\nWhat is the smallest number of operations which need to be performed in order to make the directed tree rooted?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nEach of the next N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two space-separated integers uuu and vvv denoting that there is a directed edge from uuu to vvv in the tree.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the smallest number of operations we need to perform to create a rooted directed tree.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\le N \\le 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le u, v \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\nthe graph described on the input is a directed tree\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 10510^5105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points): for each edge, u=1u = 1u=1 or v=1v = 1v=1 (the graph is a directed star)\nSubtask #2 (80 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n3\n1 2\n3 2\n3\n1 2\n2 31\n0\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: We can delete the edge from vertex 333 to vertex 222 and insert an edge from 333 to 111. Then, the graph becomes a rooted directed tree with vertex 333 as the root. However, there are many other possible solutions.\nExample case 2: The graph is already a rooted directed tree; the root is vertex 111."
