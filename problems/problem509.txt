b"Problem\nGeralt is an expert alchemist but always finds it difficult to find the right herbs. So he started his own farm of herbs, where he would grow his own herbs. Right now, he has NNN different herbs in a row on his farm. He was getting bored, so he came up with a challenging problem for you:\nYou are allowed to divide the NNN herbs into non-empty groups by creating some partitions (possibly zero) between the herbs such that each group contains at most MMM herbs. Your task is to find the number of distinct groupings. Since the answer can be large, print it modulo 109+710^9+7109+7.\nNote: Two groupings are considered distinct if\n\nBoth contain a different number of groups, else if\nThe ithi^{th}ith groups (from the left) for both groupings contain different numbers of herbs.\n\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, the number of test cases. Then TTT test cases follow.\nEach test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and MMM.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, output in a single line the required answer modulo 109+710^9+7109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq T \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa420001 \\leq N \\leq 20001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq M \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4N\n\nSample Input:\n4\n1 1\n3 2\n2 1\n8 3\nSample Output:\n1\n3\n1\n81\nExplanation:\nFor the 2nd2^{nd}2nd test case, the different groupings are: (1,1,1),(1,2)(1,1,1), (1,2)(1,1,1),(1,2) and (2,1)(2,1)(2,1). Here, the numbers in the braces represent the number of herbs in each group for the respective grouping. There's only one possible grouping for test case 111 and 333, i.e., group each herb individually."
