b'Problem\n\xc2\xa0\nProblem description.\n\xc2\xa0Dexter has made a robot named Hexabot. Hexabot moves in a series of one-sixth circular arcs (60\xc2\xb0).\n\n\n(This image is for Pentabot, arcs of 72 degrees. See explanation for more details)\n\n\nAt any point it can either move in a clockwise or an anticlockwise direction, but it cannot turn on the spot. It is allowed to cross its path and it is allowed to traverse an arc more than once (i.e. retrace a part of its walk). In how many ways can the robot return to its starting point in exactly n moves?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follows\nEach line of a test case has an integer n.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the number of ways in which Hexabot can return to its starting point in exactly n moves".\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 70\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n1\n7\nOutput:\n2\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\n\n\n'
