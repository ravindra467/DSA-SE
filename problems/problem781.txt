b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Russian, Vietnamese, Hindi, Mandarin chinese and Bengali as well.\nAlice, Bob and Charlie are playing a new game called Buddy NIM. The game is played at two tables; on the first table, there are NNN heaps containing A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b stones and on the second table, there are MMM heaps containing B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BMB_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_MB1\xe2\x80\x8b,B2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,BM\xe2\x80\x8b stones respectively.\nInitially, Alice is playing at the first table and Bob is playing at the second table. The players take their turns in this order: Charlie, Alice, Bob, Charlie, etc.\nAlice and Bob follow the rules for classical NIM - on Alice\'s turn, Alice must remove a positive number of stones from one of the piles at her current table and on Bob\'s turn, Bob must remove a positive number of stones from one of the piles at his current table. Whoever cannot remove any stone from a pile loses.\nCharlie does not play at any table. Instead, on his turn, he decides if Alice and Bob should keep playing at their respective tables or swap places.\nAlice and Charlie are buddies and they cooperate, playing in the optimal way that results in Alice\'s victory (if possible).\nIt is clear that either Alice or Bob wins the game eventually. You must find out who the winner will be.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each testcase contains two space-separated integers NNN and MMM.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b.\nThe third line contains MMM space-separated integers B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BMB_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_MB1\xe2\x80\x8b,B2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,BM\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single line containing the string "Alice" if Alice wins or "Bob" if Bob wins.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41021 \\le T \\le 10^21\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4102\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41021 \\le N, M \\le 10^21\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4102\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41090 \\le A_i \\le 10^90\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid iii\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Bi\xe2\x89\xa41090 \\le B_i \\le 10^90\xe2\x89\xa4Bi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid iii\n\nExample Input\n3\n3 1\n1 1 1\n3\n3 1\n1 2 4\n7\n1 1\n1\n1\n\nExample Output\nAlice\nAlice\nBob\n'
