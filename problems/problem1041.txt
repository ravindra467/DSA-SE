b'Problem\nA binary string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters of the string are equal. Formally, a binary string TTT of length MMM is called alternating if Ti\xe2\x89\xa0Ti+1T_i \\neq T_{i +1}Ti\xe2\x80\x8b\xee\x80\xa0=Ti+1\xe2\x80\x8b for each 1\xe2\x89\xa4i<M1 \\leq i \\lt M1\xe2\x89\xa4i<M.\nFor example, 0, 1, 01, 10, 101, 010, 1010 are alternating strings while 11, 001, 1110 are not.\nYou are given a binary string SSS of length NNN. You would like to rearrange the characters of SSS such that the length of the longest alternating substring of SSS is maximum. Find this maximum value.\nA binary string is a string that consists of characters 0 and 1. A string aaa is a substring of a string bbb if aaa can be obtained from bbb by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains an integer TTT, denoting the number of test cases. The TTT test cases then follow:\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer NNN.\nThe second line of each test case contains the binary string SSS.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output the maximum possible length of the longest alternating substring of SSS after rearrangement.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\leq T \\leq 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nSSS contains only the characters 0 and 1.\nSum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052 \\cdot 10^52\xe2\x8b\x85105.\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4\n3\n110\n4\n1010\n4\n0000\n7\n1101101\n3\n4\n1\n5\n\nExplanation:\nTest case 111: Swapping the second and third characters makes S=101S=101S=101. Hence the length of the longest alternating substring is 333 (choosing the entire string as a substring).\nTest case 222: The given string S=1010S=1010S=1010 is an alternating string of length 444.\nTest case 333: The length of the longest alternating substring is 111 for any rearrangement of  S=0000S=0000S=0000.\nTest case 444: One possible rearrangement of SSS is 110101\xe2\x80\xbe11\\underline{10101}1110101\xe2\x80\x8b1, which has an alternating substring of length 555 (the substring starting at index 222 and ending at index 666).'
