b'Problem\nThere are NNN people working in a building, and each one works in a separate cabin. Chef\xe2\x80\x99s employees are numbered by integers from 111 to NNN, inclusive. Chef wants to ensure the safety of his employees. He wants to have fire escapes in the building and wants to train the employees to use these by conducting mock drills.\nChef knows that the number of people working in his office can be very large. In order to avoid crowding of a common fire escape route during emergency, Chef has decided to build multiple fire escapes. For the safety of every employee, each cabin has a fire exit which is connected to one of the fire escape routes.\nA lot of employees are friends with each other. The friendship is mutual. This means that if employee iii is a friend of employee jjj then employee jjj is a friend of employee iii as well. But friendship is NOT necessarily transitive. This means that if employee iii is a friend of employee jjj AND employee jjj is a friend of employee kkk, then employee iii and employee kkk need not necessarily be friends.\nIf two employees are friends, they do not want to escape through different routes.\nThis complicates the task for the Chef. As already mentioned, he wants to have the maximum number of fire escape routes to ensure maximum safety. Also, for every escape route, one of the employees using that route needs to be appointed as the fire drill captain. The captain will be responsible for conducting the mock drills and train all the employees using that route. Your task is simple. Given the number of employees and the friendship list, you need to tell the Chef the maximum number of fire escape routes that he can have in the building and the number of ways of selecting the captains for every route. Since the number of ways can be really large, output this value modulo 109+710^{9} + 7109+7.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and MMM, denoting the number of employees and the number of friendship relations, respectively.\nEach of the following MMM lines contains two space-separated integers iii and jjj, denoting that employee iii and employee jjj are friends.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing two space separated integers, denoting the maximum number of distinct fire escape routes that can be constructed and the number of ways of selecting the captains modulo 109+710^{9} + 7109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa451 \\leq T \\leq 51\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^{5}1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41050 \\leq M \\leq 10^{5}0\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq i, j \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4N\ni\xe2\x89\xa0j i \\neq ji\xee\x80\xa0=j\nFor any pair of employees iii and jjj such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq i, j \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4N, at most one pair among (i,j)(i, j)(i,j) and (j,i)(j, i)(j,i) will appear in the input\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n4 2\n1 2\n2 3\n5 3\n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\n6 3\n1 2\n3 4\n5 62 3\n3 3\n3 8\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: Here employees 111 and 222 are friends and should share the same fire escape. Also employees 222 and 333 share the same fire escape. This means employees 111, 222, and 333 will have a common route. But to maximize number of routes Chef could assign another route to employee 444 since it is not a friend of other employee. So we have two escape routes with the following distribution of employees by routes: {1,2,3}\\{1, 2, 3\\}{1,2,3}, {4}\\{4\\}{4}. Therefore, there are 333 ways to chose drill captains: (1,4)(1, 4)(1,4), (2,4)(2, 4)(2,4), (3,4)(3, 4)(3,4), where first element in the pair denotes the captain for the first route and second element denotes the captain for the second route.\nExample case 2: Here the optimal distribution of employees by routes is {1,2,3}\\{1, 2, 3\\}{1,2,3}, {4}\\{4\\}{4}, {5}\\{5\\}{5}. Therefore, there are 333 ways to chose drill captains: (1,4,5)(1, 4, 5)(1,4,5), (2,4,5)(2, 4, 5)(2,4,5), (3,4,5)(3, 4, 5)(3,4,5).\nExample case 3: Here the optimal distribution of employees by routes is {1,2}\\{1, 2\\}{1,2}, {3,4}\\{3, 4\\}{3,4}, {5,6}\\{5, 6\\}{5,6}. Therefore, there are 8 ways to chose drill captains: (1,3,5)(1, 3, 5)(1,3,5), (1,3,6)(1, 3, 6)(1,3,6), (1,4,5)(1, 4, 5)(1,4,5), (1,4,6)(1, 4, 6)(1,4,6), (2,3,5)(2, 3, 5)(2,3,5), (2,3,6)(2, 3, 6)(2,3,6), (2,4,5)(2, 4, 5)(2,4,5), (2,4,6)(2, 4, 6)(2,4,6).'
