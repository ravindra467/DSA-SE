b'Problem\nLet M be a fixed positive integer. Your task is for each R from 0 to M \xe2\x88\x92 1, inclusive, find the minimal non-negative integer having residue R modulo M and having the minimal weighted digit sum.\nNamely, let W[0], W[1], ..., W[9] be the sequence of weights assigned to the decimal digits. For positive integer N having decimal representation D1D2...DK the weighted digit sum of N is the number WS(N) = W[D1] + W[D2] + ... + W[DK]. We set WS(0) = 0 by definition.\nFor each R from 0 to M \xe2\x88\x92 1, inclusive, denote Smin(R) = min{WS(R + K * M) : K = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}. Therefore, Smin(R) is the minimal weighted digit sum over all non-negative integers having residue R modulo M. Next, denote by Nmin(R) the minimum non-negative integer having residue R modulo M and having weighted digit sum equal to Smin(R). So, formally, Nmin(R) = min{N \xe2\x89\xa5 0 : N mod M = R, WS(N) = Smin(R)}. Note, that Smin(0) = Nmin(0) = 0 for any M and any sequence of weights.\nAs mentioned above, your task is for the given M and W[0], W[1], ..., W[9] find the sequence Nmin(0), Nmin(1), ..., Nmin(M \xe2\x88\x92 1). Since the output could be quite large output the following sum instead:F(Nmin(0)) + F(Nmin(1)) + ... + F(Nmin(M \xe2\x88\x92 1)),where F(0) = 0 and for positive integer N with decimal representation D1D2...DK:F(N) = (D1 * 3141K\xe2\x88\x921 + D2 * 3141K\xe2\x88\x922 + ... + DK\xe2\x88\x921 * 3141 + DK) mod 232.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains an integer M. The second line contains ten space separated integers W[0], W[1], ..., W[9].\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the required sum.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 3141\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 3141592\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 W[0], W[1], ..., W[9] \xe2\x89\xa4 314\nThe sum of M in one test file does not exceed 3141592\n\nExample\nInput:\n6\n1\n3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3\n2\n0 2 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 1\n3\n0 10 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n4\n99 99 99 1 99 99 2 99 99 99\n5\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n3141\n31 41 59 26 53 58 97 93 23 0\nOutput:\n0\n9\n6\n9435\n10\n6500672892792\nExplanation\nExample case 1. Here M = 1. So we need to find F(Nmin(0)). Since Smin(0) = Nmin(0) = 0 and F(0) = 0, the answer is 0.\nExample case 2. Here M = 2 and W[0] = 0, W[1] = 2, W[9] = 1, while all remaining W[D] = 9. As mentioned above Smin(0) = Nmin(0) = 0. For R = 1 we have Smin(1) = 1 and Nmin(1) = 9 since W[9] = 1. Therefore, the answer is F(0) + F(9) = 0 + 9 = 9.\nExample case 3. Here values of Smin(R) are {0, 4, 2} and values of Nmin(R) are {0, 4, 2}. Therefore, the answer is F(0) + F(4) + F(2) = 0 + 4 + 2 = 6.\nExample case 4. Here values of Smin(R) are {0, 2, 2, 1} and values of Nmin(R) are {0, 33, 6, 3}. Since F(33) = (3 * 3141 + 3) mod 232 = 9426, the answer is F(0) + F(33) + F(6) + F(3) = 0 + 9426 + 6 + 3 = 9435.\nExample case 5. Here Smin(R) = Nmin(R) = R for all R from 0 to M \xe2\x88\x92 1, inclusive.\nExample case 6. Make sure that you calculates F(N) properly here. Also note that Nmin(666) = 10106 \xe2\x88\x92 1 and Nmin(3140) = 10116 \xe2\x88\x92 2 for M = 3141 and given sequence of weights. It means that brute force solution is not applicable even for such relatively small value of M.'
