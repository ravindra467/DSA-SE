b'Problem\n\xc2\xa0\nArush was not always poor at Mathematics but his recent performances had not been that good and he had lost his confidence. Now his elder brother was determined to bring back his confidence back in Mathematics.\nSo he made a tricky question and made sure that Arush would be able to do solve it. The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n! , is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.\nn! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ...... * 1\n\nArush\xe2\x80\x99s elder brother so defined a function F(x) for positive integer x as the product of factorials of its constituting digits.\nFor example, F(125) = 1! * 2! * 5!.\nYou are given a number N that contains d digits and contains at least one digit larger than 1.\nThe problem is to find maximum positive number M which should contain neither the digit 0 nor the digit 1 and also F(M) = F(N).\nThe number N may possibly start with leading zeroes.\nHelp Arush to bring his confidence back.\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains T, the number of testcases.\nThe first line contains an integer d, number of digits in N.\nNext line contains d digits of N.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\n\nOutput the maximum possible integer M that satisfies the above conditions.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\nShould contain all the constraints on the input data that you may have. Format it like:\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 50\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 d \xe2\x89\xa4 15\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n2\n1\n6\n3\n006\nOutput:\n53\n53\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nExample case 1. d = 1, N = 6. Now F(6) = 6! = 720 and F(53) = 5! * 3! = 120 * 6 = 720.'
