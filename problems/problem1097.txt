b'Problem\nA string SSS is called good if none of the substrings of SSS of length \xe2\x89\xa52\\ge 2\xe2\x89\xa52 are palindromic.\nFor e.g. S=S =S= hello\\texttt{hello}hello is not good but S=S =S= world\\texttt{world}world is good.\nYou are given a string AAA of length NNN (containing lowercase Latin letters only). Rearrange AAA to form a good string or determine it is not possible to do so.\nRecall that a string is called palindromic if it reads the same backwards and forwards. For example, noon\\texttt{noon}noon and level\\texttt{level}level are palindromic strings.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer TTT \xe2\x80\x94 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer NNN \xe2\x80\x94 the length of the string AAA.\nThe second line of each test case contains the string AAA of length NNN.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, if it is possible to rearrange AAA to convert it into a good string, print YES in the first line and print the rearranged string in the second line. Otherwise, print NO.\nYou may print each character of YES and NO in uppercase or lowercase (for e.g. yes, yEs, Yes will be considered identical).\nIf there are multiple rearrangements of the string which are good, print any of them.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq T \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nThe string AAA contains lowercase Latin letters only\nThe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052 \\cdot 10^52\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4\n5\nworld\n5\nhello\n7\naaabbcc\n6\npppppr\nYES\nworld\nYES\nlehol\nYES\nabcabca\nNO\n\nExplanation:\nTest case 111: world\\texttt{world}world is already a good string.\nTest case 222: hello\\texttt{hello}hello can be rearranged to form lehol\\texttt{lehol}lehol which is good.\nTest case 333: aaabbcc\\texttt{aaabbcc}aaabbcc can be rearranged to form abcabca\\texttt{abcabca}abcabca which is good.\nTest case 444: It can be proven that none of the rearrangements of pppppr\\texttt{pppppr}pppppr is good.'
