b"Problem\nDivesh loves water, and more than that he loves quenching the thirst of others with water. Today he is on a mission to quench the thirst of people in the city. The city is in the form of an N\xc3\x97MN \\times MN\xc3\x97M grid denoted by AN\xc3\x97MA_{N \\times M}AN\xc3\x97M\xe2\x80\x8b. Furthermore, the city is divided into regions. Each cell in the grid has an ID denoted by Ai,jA_{i, j}Ai,j\xe2\x80\x8b. Each cell can have at most 888 neighbouring cells (Top Left, Top, Top Right, Right, Down Right, Down, Down Left, Left). Now, a region is a connected area of cells with the same ID. Two cells are said to be connected to each other if and only if they have the same ID and they are neighbours to each other. The size (or area) of a region is the number of cells it contains.\nNow, Divesh can only visit a single region for his task and he has only KKK units of water with him, each of which can be used to quench the thirst of people in a single cell. He wants to utilize all of the KKK units of water he has. If he cannot utilize all of the KKK units of water in any region, then he doesn't have any choice but to abort the mission. Otherwise he has to select a region in which the number of choices are minimized, as he hates selecting from a number of choices offered to him. Suppose if he can visit a region for his mission with size XXX, then he can have multiple ways of choosing KKK cells among those XXX to be helped. Divesh hates discrimination so he wants to find a region with the minimum number of choices (because he knows how it feels being left out).\nCan you help him find the minimum number of choices? (Since it can be large, so find it modulo 109+710^9 + 7109+7)\nInput:\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space separated integers NNN, MMM and KKK.\nNNN lines follow, for each iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N)(1 \\leq i \\leq N)(1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the ithi^{th}ith of these lines contains MMM space separated integers Ai,1,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ai,MA_{i, 1}, \\dots, A_{i, M}Ai,1\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ai,M\xe2\x80\x8b\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case print a single line containing an integer denoting the minimum number of choices modulo 109+710^9 + 7109+7.\nIf it is not possible to find such a choice, print \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 in a single line.\nConstraints:\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq T \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N.M\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N.M \\leq 10^{5}1\xe2\x89\xa4N.M\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,j\xe2\x89\xa4N.M1 \\leq A_{i, j} \\leq N.M1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,j\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4N.M, for each valid pair (i,j)(i, j)(i,j)\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N.M1 \\leq K \\leq N.M1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N.M\n\nSubtasks:\n\n30 points: 1\xe2\x89\xa4N.M\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq N.M \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4N.M\xe2\x89\xa4100\n70 points: original constraints\n\nSample Input:\n2\r\n3 3 2\r\n1 1 1\r\n1 2 2\r\n3 3 3\r\n3 3 5\r\n1 1 1\r\n1 2 2\r\n3 3 3\n\nSample Output:\n1\r\n-1\n\nExplanation:\n\nExample Case 1: There are a total of 333 regions here, and the number of 2\xe2\x88\x922-2\xe2\x88\x92choices are minimized when we select the region formed by cells A2,2A_{2, 2}A2,2\xe2\x80\x8b and A2,3A_{2, 3}A2,3\xe2\x80\x8b.\nExample Case 2: There is no valid 5\xe2\x88\x925-5\xe2\x88\x92choice here (the grid is exactly the same as in case 111).\n"
