b'Problem\nNaruto is conducting exams for the junior ninjas and has come up with a new form of examination.\r\nA maze of MMM X MMM is constructed in the form of a matrix (1-indexed). Each cell has a monster of power level Mi,jM_{i,j}Mi,j\xe2\x80\x8b.\nThe ninjas also have their power level PPP and they can only beat monsters with power level strictly less than their own power level.\nThe ninjas are made to enter the maze at the cell indexed 1,11,11,1. The ninjas fight the monster and if they win, they can clone themselves and send one clone each towards left, right, up, and down to fight other monsters. They can send a clone to a cell only once and the clones have power the same as the original. The clones upon entering a new cell, fight the monster and the whole process is repeated.\nYou will be asked QQQ queries, for each query you will be given the power level of the ninja entering the maze. Find the number of monsters he or she will kill.\nWith some weird technique, Naruto revives all the killed monsters after each query for the next ninja.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nFirst line contains NNN and QQQ.\nFollowing NNN lines represent the matrix, each line containing NNN integers.\nThe nest line contains QQQ elements, each representing a query.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, print QQQ lines, of which the ithi^{th}ith line is the answer to the ithi^{th}ith query.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq T \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n2\xe2\x89\xa4M,Q\xe2\x89\xa41032 \\leq M,Q \\leq 10^32\xe2\x89\xa4M,Q\xe2\x89\xa4103\n2\xe2\x89\xa4Mi,j,Pi\xe2\x89\xa41052 \\leq M_{i,j}, P_i \\leq 10^52\xe2\x89\xa4Mi,j\xe2\x80\x8b,Pi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\nSample Input:\n1\r\n3 4\r\n1 3 4 \r\n2 4 3\r\n9 3 8 \r\n4 1 10 3\n\nSample Output:\n3\r\n0\r\n9\r\n2\r\n\t\n\nEXPLANATION:\nSecond query: The power level is not enough to beat the monster in the cell [1,1], so the answer is 0.\nThird query: The power is high enough to beat all monsters.\nFirst query: Can kill monsters in the cell [1,1], [2,1] and [1,2].\nFourth Query: Can kill monsters in the cell [1,1] and [1,2].'
