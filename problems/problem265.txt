b"Problem\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.\nYou are given a tree with NNN vertices (numbered 111 through NNN) and a bag with NNN markers. There is an integer written on each marker; each of these integers is 000, 111 or 222. You must assign exactly one marker to each vertex.\nLet's define the unattractiveness of the resulting tree as the maximum absolute difference of integers written on the markers in any two vertices which are connected by an edge.\nFind the minimum possible unattractiveness of the resulting tree.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers denoting the numbers on markers in the bag.\nEach of the next N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two space-separated integers uuu and vvv denoting an edge between vertices uuu and vvv.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum unattractiveness.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4301 \\le T \\le 301\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa430\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le N \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le u, v \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\nthe graph described on the input is a tree\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n3\n0 1 1\n1 2\n1 3\n3\n0 1 2\n1 2\n1 3\n4\n2 2 2 2\n1 2\n1 3\n3 41\n1\n0\nExplanation:\nExample case 1:"
