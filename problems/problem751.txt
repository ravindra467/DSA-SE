b"Problem\nYou are climbing an infinity staircase, which (as its name suggests) has an infinite number of steps. You are currently standing at the 111st step, and you would like to reach the NNN-th step. When standing at the iii-th step, you can make one of the following three moves:\n\nMove to step i+1{i+1}i+1\nMove to step i+2{i+2}i+2\nMove to step i+3{i+3}i+3\n\nHowever, you can't make the same move twice in a row.\nFor example, suppose you reach the 777th step from the 444th step using the third move. Then, from the 777th step, you can move to either the 888th or the 999th step (using the 111st or 222nd move) \xe2\x80\x94 but you can't move to the 101010th step (because you would use the third move twice in a row). Now suppose you choose the 111st move and move to the 888th step. On your next move, you cannot move to the 999th step, but you can move to either the 101010th or the 111111th step.\nUnder these conditions, find the minimum number of moves you need to reach the NNN-th step.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input will contain a single integer TTT, denoting the number of test cases.\nEach test case consists of a single line containing one integer, NNN.\n\nOutput Format\n\nFor each test case, print on a new line the minimum number of moves required to reach the NNN-th step.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le T \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\le N \\le 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput5\n2\n3\n5\n1\n7\n1\n1\n2\n0\n3\n\nExplanation:\nTest case 111: Moving to the second step from the first takes only one move.\nTest case 222: Moving to the third step from the first also takes only one move.\nTest case 333: Moving to the fifth step can be done as follows: 1\xe2\x86\x92+12\xe2\x86\x92+351 \\xrightarrow[]{+1} 2 \\xrightarrow[]{+3} 51+1\xe2\x80\x8b2+3\xe2\x80\x8b5.\nTest case 444: No moves need to be made.\nTest case 555: Moving to the seventh step can be done as follows: 1\xe2\x86\x92+12\xe2\x86\x92+24\xe2\x86\x92+371 \\xrightarrow[]{+1} 2 \\xrightarrow[]{+2} 4 \\xrightarrow[]{+3} 71+1\xe2\x80\x8b2+2\xe2\x80\x8b4+3\xe2\x80\x8b7. Note that while the sequence 1\xe2\x86\x92+34\xe2\x86\x92+371 \\xrightarrow[]{+3} 4 \\xrightarrow[]{+3} 71+3\xe2\x80\x8b4+3\xe2\x80\x8b7 reaches it in two moves, it is not a valid sequence since the same move is made twice in a row."
