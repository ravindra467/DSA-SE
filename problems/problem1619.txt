b"Problem\n\nIt is time for the final face-off. Now Batman must travel to where Superman is waiting as soon as possible. However, it happens that a road maintenance task is currently underway in Metropolis. Batman knows that the city policy dictates only one road can be repaired at a time. So he must come up with the shortest route quickly as soon as he learns which road is being repaired.\nThe city is designed as a graph having 'V' vertices and 'E'  bidirectional roads. Batman starts from one of these vertices and his destination is also one of these vertices.\nInput\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The first line of the input is T number of test cases. T test cases follow.\n\xe2\x80\xa2For each test case, the first line contains 2 space separated integers V and E.\n\xe2\x80\xa2The next E lines follow, each containing 3 space separated integers u, v, w, where u and v denote the\nvertices connected by a road and w being the length of the road. u and v will always be different.\n\xe2\x80\xa2The next line contains 2 space separated B and S, denoting the vertices of Batman and Superman's\nposition respectively.\n\xe2\x80\xa2The next line contains a single integer Q denoting the number of queries\n\xe2\x80\xa2The next Q lines each contain two integers u and v, denoting that the road connect u and v is\nunder maintenance.\n\nOutput\n\xe2\x80\xa2For each query, output a single line containing the minimum distance Batman needs to travel to get to his\ndestination. If it is impossible to do so, output -1.\n\nConstraints\n1<=T<=5\n1<=V<=200000\n1<=E<=200000\n1<=Q<=200000\n1<=w<=1000\n1<=B,S<=V\n\nExample\n\n\nInput\n1\n6 9\n0 1 1\n1 2 1\n2 3 1\n3 4 1\n4 5 1\n2 4 5\n3 5 8\n1 3 3\n0 2 4\n0 5\n9\n0 1\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n2 4\n3 5\n1 3\n0 2\nOutput\n7\n6\n6\n8\n11\n5\n5\n5\n5\n"
