b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChefina calls a sequence good if there is no way to divide it into two non-empty contiguous subsequences (not necessarily with equal length) such that the bitwise OR of the elements of one subsequence is equal to the bitwise OR of the elements of the other subsequence.\nYou are given a sequence of positive integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b. Chefina asked Chef to reorder the elements of this sequence (possibly leaving it unchanged) in such a way that the resulting sequence would be good \xe2\x80\x95 if it is possible. However, that was an easy task for Chef, so whenever it is possible to make the given sequence good, Chefina asked him to do it by swapping adjacent pairs of its elements and to use the smallest possible number of swaps.\nFind the smallest number of swaps Chef needs to perform in order to make the given sequence good or determine that there is no way to make it good.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the smallest number of swaps Chef needs to make the sequence good or \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le T \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le N \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\le A_i \\le 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4106 for each valid iii\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x851055\\cdot 10^55\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points):\n\nN\xe2\x89\xa41,000N \\le 1,000N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 5,0005,0005,000\n\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n3\n3 6 7\n2\n4 4\n7\n2 3 9 13 14 6 131\n-1\n5'
