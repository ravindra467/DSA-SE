b'Problem\nThe only difference between the easy and hard versions is the contraints.\nIn the new secret NASA, there are n astronauts. Professor Brand wants to form a team headed by Dr Mann for the Lazarus mission. Astronauts will team up in pairs for the mission. But there is one condition: two astronauts will team up with one another if and only if each person believes that the other person is good enough for him.\nAn astronaut considers another good enough for him if and only if the other person has an astronaut rating of at least half of his own.\nThe professor now wonders, how many pairs can be formed among the astronauts.\r\nFind the number of pairs possible.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains TTT, the number of test cases.\nFor each test case, the first line contains nnn, the number of astronauts.\nThe next line has nnn integers, the ratings of the astronauts.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq T \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq n \\leq10^51\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4a[i]\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq a[i] \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4a[i]\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nOutput Format\nOutput one line for each test case - the number of pairs possible among the astronauts.\nSample Input\n2\r\n5\r\n1 4 9 16 25\r\n6\r\n2 3 4 4 18 22\n\nSample Output\n2\r\n7\n'
