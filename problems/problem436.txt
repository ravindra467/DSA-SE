b'Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nConsider the sequence of K natural numbers: a1, a2, ..., aK. Tooru thinks that this sequence is nice if and only if:\na1+a2+...+aK = N\na1 < a2 < ... < aK\nai+1 - ai <= D for every natural i, smaller than K\na1 <= D\n\nYou are given N, K and D. Please, count the number of nice sequences for her. This number can be huge, so we ask you to output it modulo 109+7.\n\nInput\nThe first and only line of the input consists of the integers N, K and D, separated by a single space.\nOutput\nOutput the number of nice sequences on the first line of the output modulo 109+7.\nExample\nInput:\n10 4 1\nOutput:\n1\n\nExplanation\nThe only suitable sequence is (1, 2, 3, 4).\nScoring\n1 <= N, K, D <= 10 : 17 points.\n1 <= N, K, D <= 400 : 23 points. 1 <= N, K, D <= 2000 : 20 points.\n1 <= N, K, D <= 105 : 40 points.'
