b"Problem\nIt's Valentine's Month, and so Chef wants to gift a string to Chefina. He knows that Chefina likes palindromic strings. Chef has a string SSS consisting of digits from 000 to 999. He wants to convert this to a palindrome by performing zero or more operations, where an operation is defined as follows:\n\nPick any digit and replace all of its occurrences with any other digit.\n\nFor example, if S=12123S = 12123S=12123, in one move it can be turned into 141431414314143 or 121281212812128, but not 321233212332123.\nYou are also given NNN integers cost1,cost2,\xe2\x80\xa6,costN\\text{cost}_1, \\text{cost}_2, \\ldots, \\text{cost}_Ncost1\xe2\x80\x8b,cost2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,costN\xe2\x80\x8b, where the cost of performing an operation that replaces XXX characters is costX\\text{cost}_XcostX\xe2\x80\x8b.\nYour task is to help Chef minimize the cost of converting his string to a palindrome.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nEach test case consists of 333 lines of input.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN, denoting the length of the string.\nThe second line of each test case contains a string of length NNN, consisting of only the digits 000 to 999.\nThe third line of each test case contains NNN space-separated integers, denoting the cost array.\n\n\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output on a new line the answer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum cost to convert the string to a palindrome.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\leq T \\leq 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nSSS contains only the digits 000 to 999\n1\xe2\x89\xa4costi\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq \\text{cost}_i \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4costi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4105\nThe sum of NNN over all test cases doesn't exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\\cdot 10^52\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4\n4\n7572\n5 1 4 3\n3\n010\n1 3 2\n6\n437022\n5 1 3 2 1 1\n4\n1112\n4 2 3 5\n5\n0\n7\n3\n\nExplanation:\nTest case 111: Replace all occurrences of 777 with 222 and then replace all occurrences of 222 with 555, making the final string 555555555555. The cost of doing this is 1+4=51 + 4 = 51+4=5.\nTest case 222: The cost is 000 since the given string is already a palindrome.\nTest case 333: We perform the following operations:\n\nReplace 222 with 000 with a cost of 111.\nReplace 000 with 333 with a cost of 333.\nReplace 333 with 444 with a cost of 222.\nReplace 444 with 777 with a cost of 111.\n\nTherefore, the total cost is 1+3+2+1=71 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 71+3+2+1=7.\nTest case 444: We can replace all occurrences of 111 with 222, incurring a total cost of 333.\nIn all the examples above, it can be shown that it is not possible to convert the string to a palindrome at a lower cost."
