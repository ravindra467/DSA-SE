b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Mandarin, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a tree with NNN nodes rooted at node 111, and your task is to color each node of the tree either white or black. For each iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq i \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), let wiw_iwi\xe2\x80\x8b be the number of white nodes that occurs in a simple path from the root node to ithi^{th}ith node and bib_ibi\xe2\x80\x8b be the number of black nodes that occurs in a simple path from the root node to ithi^{th}ith node. The cost of a node iii is defined as the absolute difference between wiw_iwi\xe2\x80\x8b and bib_ibi\xe2\x80\x8b.\nThe cost of the tree is defined as the summation of the cost of all the nodes in the tree. The value of the tree is defined as the absolute difference between the total number of white nodes and the total number of black nodes in the tree. You have to color the tree in such a way that the cost of the tree is minimized.\nYour task is to answer a single query QQQ, such that:\n\nIf Q=1Q = 1Q=1, Determine the maximum value the tree can have after minimizing the cost of the tree.\nIf Q=2Q = 2Q=2, Determine the minimum value the tree can have after minimizing the cost of the tree.\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains an integer TTT, denoting the number of test cases. The TTT test cases then follow:\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers NNN and QQQ, denoting the number of nodes in the tree and the query to answer respectively.\nThe next N\xe2\x88\x921N - 1N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contain two space-separated integers uuu and vvv, denoting that there is an edge between the node uuu and the node vvv.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the answer to the query.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq T \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa421 \\leq Q \\leq 21\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa42\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n,u\xe2\x89\xa0v1 \\leq u,v \\leq n, u \\neq v1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n,u\xee\x80\xa0=v\n\xe2\x88\x91N\\sum{N}\xe2\x88\x91N over all test cases does not exceed 10510^5105.\nIt is guaranteed that the given nodes and edges form a tree.\n\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 (20 points):\n\nQ=1Q = 1Q=1\n\nSubtask #2 (80 points):\n\nOriginal constraints\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n5 1\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n5 2\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n3\n1\n\nExplanation:\nTest case 1: Color the node 111 with black color and color the nodes 2,3,4,52, 3, 4, 52,3,4,5 with white color to get the minimum cost of the tree, that is 333, and the maximum value of the tree, that is 333.\nTest case 2: Color the nodes 1,41, 41,4 with black color and color the nodes 2,3,52, 3, 52,3,5 with white color to get the minimum cost of the tree, that is 333, and the minimum value of the tree, that is 111.'
