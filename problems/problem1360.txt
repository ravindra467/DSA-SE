b"Problem\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef and his little brother are playing with sticks. Initially, Chef has NNN sticks with lengths A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\dots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b. He should give his little brother at least KKK of these sticks. Afterwards, Chef's brother should choose four sticks and use them to form a rectangle (a square is also a rectangle). Chef does not want his brother to break any of the sticks, so each of the chosen sticks should be one side of the rectangle.\nChef's little brother wants the rectangle he makes to have the maximum possible area, while Chef wants it to have the minimum possible area. Therefore, Chef wants to choose the sticks to give his brother in such a way that they cannot be used to form a rectangle; if it's impossible, then he wants to choose the sticks in such a way that the maximum area of a rectangle his little brother can form is minimum possible.\nCan you find the area of the resulting rectangle (or determine that it won't be possible to form any) if both Chef and his little brother play optimally?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and KKK.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\dots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the area of the resulting rectangle or \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 if Chef can give his brother sticks that cannot be used to form any rectangle.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le T \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le N \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N0 \\le K \\le N0\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 10510^5105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\le A_i \\le 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid iii\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n7 6\n1 2 3 1 2 2 1\n5 4\n1 2 1 2 32\n-1\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: Chef should give his brother all sticks except one. Regardless of the length of that one stick, Chef's brother can choose sticks with lengths 1,2,1,21, 2, 1, 21,2,1,2 to create a rectangle with area 1\xe2\x8b\x852=21 \\cdot 2 = 21\xe2\x8b\x852=2.\nExample case 2: If Chef gives his brother sticks with lengths 2,1,2,32, 1, 2, 32,1,2,3, then there is no way to form a rectangle."
