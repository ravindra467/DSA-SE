b'Problem\n"Say my Name".\nTodd Alquist is being taught the process of cooking methamphetamine, but to see whether he\'s really capable of learning it, Walt gives him a problem to solve. Since he can\'t solve it, he asks you for help.\nYou are given a tree with NNN vertices (numbered 111 through NNN), rooted at the vertex 111. There is an integer written at each vertex; for each valid iii, the value of vertex iii is AAAiii.There also exists a special integer KKK.\nChoose any leaf node, denoted by XXX, and go down a simple path from rootrootroot to XXX.\nLet SSS denote the set of all nodes lying on the simple path from rootrootroot to XXX.\nFor all iii \xcf\xb5\\epsilon \xcf\xb5 SSS, choose an integer DDD \xcf\xb5\\epsilon\xcf\xb5 [2A[i]\xe2\x88\x921,2A[i])[2^{A[i]-1},2^{A[i]})[2A[i]\xe2\x88\x921,2A[i]).\nInformally, for every node iii lying on the simple path from rootrootroot to XXX, you have to choose an integer DDD such that  2A[i]\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x89\xa4D<2A[i]2^{A[i]-1}\\leq D \\lt 2^{A[i]}2A[i]\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x89\xa4D<2A[i].\nYou now have to perform one of the two following operations :\n1. Bitwise XOR of all chosen integers.\n2. Bitwise AND of all chosen integers.\nYou have to determine whether you can choose the values in such a way that after performing one of the given operations you can get an integer equal to KKK.\n\nNote : A leaf is a node of the tree without any child nodes.\n\nDetermine if it is possible to obtain the value KKK by performing the given operations.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nFirst line of each testcase contains two space separated integers N,KN, KN,K denoting the number of nodes and the value of the special integer .\nN\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 lines follow , each line contains two space separated integers u,vu,vu,v denoting an edge between uuu and vvv.\nA single line follows containing NNN space separated integers denoting the value of nodes.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line "YES"(without quotes) or "NO"(without quotes).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100001 \\leq T \\leq 100001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x88\x971052 \\leq N \\leq 5*10^52\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x88\x97105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa410181 \\leq K \\leq 10^{18}1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41018\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq u,v \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A[i]\xe2\x89\xa464 1\\leq A[i] \\leq 641\xe2\x89\xa4A[i]\xe2\x89\xa464\nSum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 1e6.### Sample Input:\n1\n6 85\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n4 5\n3 6\n3 5 4 7 1 9\n\nSample Output:\nYES\n### EXPLANATION:\n\nThere are two leaf nodes, 5 and 6\nconsidering path from root to 5\nwe have nodes\n1->2->4->5\nwe can select the values\n5,26,75,1 and perform operation 1 that is XOR of all numbers to get 85'
