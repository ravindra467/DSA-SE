b'Problem\nChef gets confused between mean and median very often, and as a result, he has developed a dislike of arrays whose mean and median are not equal.\nChef has an array AAA of NNN elements. He can perform the following operation on it:\n\nPick an index 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq i \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N and increase AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b by 111.\n\nHe would like to obtain an array whose mean and median are equal. Determine the minimum number of operations required to achieve this.\nNote: The median of an array AAA of length NNN is defined as follows:\nSort the array AAA. Then,\n\nIf NNN is even, the median is the (N2)th(\\frac{N}{2})^{\\text{th}}(2N\xe2\x80\x8b)th element\nIf NNN is odd, the median is the (N+12)th(\\frac{N + 1}{2})^{\\text{th}}(2N+1\xe2\x80\x8b)th element\n\nFor example, the median of the array [3,4,1,2][3,4,1,2][3,4,1,2] is 222 and the median of the array [3,4,1][3,4,1][3,4,1] is 333.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer TTT, denoting the number of testcases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN, denoting the size of the array.\nThe second line of each test case contains NNN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of operations Chef needs to perform to make the mean and median equal.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\leq T \\leq 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4104\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851052 \\leq N \\leq 3 \\cdot 10^52\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\nSum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x851053 \\cdot 10^53\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n3\n1 2 3\n4\n1 1 3 3\n5\n1 1000000000 1 1000000000 1\n0\n4\n500000002\n\nExplanation:\nTest Case 111: The mean and median of the array are both 222. They are already equal, so no operations are required.\nTest Case 222: It is optimal to apply the operation on 1st1^{st}1st and 2nd2^{nd}2nd index twice each. The array after applying these operations will be [3,3,3,3][3, 3, 3, 3][3,3,3,3], which has both mean and median 333.'
