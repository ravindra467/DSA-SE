b"Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given an unrooted tree. There is an integer written on each node of this tree.\nYour task is to count the number of ways to decompose this tree to a set of paths in such a way that each node belongs to exactly one path and the sum of numbers associated with all the nodes on any of these path is always non-negative.\nInput\nThe first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of nodes.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ... , AN denoting the numbers written on the corresponding nodes. \nEach of the following (N-1) lines contain a pair of space-separated integers Xj Yj denoting that there is an edge between the nodes numbered Xj and Yj.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the number of ways to decompose the tree to a set of paths, under the given condition, modulo 109+7.\nConstraints\n\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Xj, Yj \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n\n\nSubtask 1 (15 points):\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 sum of N over test case \xe2\x89\xa4 104\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n-10 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n\n\nSubtask 2 (16 points):\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 sum of N over test case \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 103\n-104 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 104\n\n\nSubtask 3 (69 points):\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 sum of N over test case \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n-104 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 104\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n1\n4\n1 10 5 -1\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\nOutput:\n4\n\n \nExplanation\nLet's list all the four possible decompositions:\n\nThe whole tree is one path. Then, the sum of nodes' associated numbers is 1 + 10 + 5 + (-1) = 15.\nOne path consists of the nodes with the indices 2 and 4, another one consists of the nodes 1 and 3. Then, the sum of nodes' associated numbers in the first path is 10 + (-1) = 9 and the sum of nodes' numbers in the second path is 1 + 5 = 6.\nOne path consists of the nodes with the indices 1, 2 and 4, another one consists of the node 3. Then, the sum of nodes' associated numbers in the first path is 1 + 10 + (-1) = 10 and the sum of nodes' numbers in the second path is 5.\nThe first path consists of the nodes with the indices 2 and 4, the second one consists of the node 1, and the third consists of the node 3. Then, the sum of nodes' associated numbers in the first path is 10 + (-1) = 9, the sum of nodes' numbers in the second path is 1, the sum of nodes' numbers in the third path is 5.\n\n"
