b'Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nWatson gives an array A of N integers A1, A2, ..., AN to Sherlock. He wants Sherlock to reorganize the array in a way such that no two adjacent numbers differ by more than 1.\nFormally, if reorganized array is B1, B2, ..., BN, then the condition that | Bi - Bi + 1 | \xe2\x89\xa4 1, for all 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i < N(where |x| denotes the absolute value of x) should be met.\nSherlock is not sure that a solution exists, so he asks you.\nInput\nFirst line contains T, number of test cases. Each test case consists of N in one line followed by N integers in next line denoting A1, A2, ..., AN.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output in one line YES or NO denoting if array A can be reorganized in required way or not.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4  109\nSum of N over all test cases  \xe2\x89\xa4 2*105\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n4\n3 2 2 3 \n2\n1 5YES\nNO\nExplanation:\n\nTest case 1:\nNo need to reorganise.\n\n\nTest case 2:\nNo possible way.\n'
