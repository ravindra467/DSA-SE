b'Problem\nA number is said to be a palindrome if it remains the same when it is read backwards. Eg. 120211202112021 is pallindrome while 212121 is not A number is called total-palindromic if it contains a palindrome with odd length greater than 111 and an even palindrome as a substring.\nFor example, the number 226762267622676 is total-palindromic whereas the number 101101101 is not because it contains the palindrome of odd length 676676676 and even length 222222. While 101101101 does not contain an even palindrome as a substring.\nYou are given two numbers aaa, bbb. Output the number of total-palindromic numbers which lie in the range (a,b](a,b](a,b] i.e set {a+1,a+2,....b}\\{ a+1, a+2, .... b\\}{a+1,a+2,....b}\nInput\n\nFirst line contains number of test cases TTT. Each test case contains two lines.\nFirst line contains the number aaa\nSecond line contains the number bbb\n\nOutput\nOutput TTT lines, each line containing an integer - the answer to the test case.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le T \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n99\xe2\x89\xa4a<b\xe2\x89\xa4101899 \\le a \\lt b \\le 10^{18}99\xe2\x89\xa4a<b\xe2\x89\xa41018\n\nSample Input:\n2\n99\n100\n110\n119\n\nSample Output:\n0\n1\n\nExplanation\nIn second test case the range is between 110110110 and 119119119 i.e the numbers 111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119. Of these only 111111111 contains the odd palindromic substring 111 and even palindromic substring 111111.\nSo the answer to this test-case is 111.'
