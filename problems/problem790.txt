b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nThere are NNN cars (numbered 111 through NNN) on a circular track with length NNN. For each iii (2\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N2 \\le i \\le N2\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the iii-th of them is at a distance i\xe2\x88\x921i-1i\xe2\x88\x921 clockwise from car 111, i.e. car 111 needs to travel a distance i\xe2\x88\x921i-1i\xe2\x88\x921 clockwise to reach car iii.\nFor each valid iii, you can fill the iii-th car's tank with up to fif_ifi\xe2\x80\x8b litres of gasoline, with cost cic_ici\xe2\x80\x8b coins per litre.\nAfter that, you choose some car, sit in this car and start driving in the clockwise direction. To move one unit of distance in this direction, you need to spend 111 litre of gasoline. When you pass another car (even if you'd run out of gasoline exactly at that point), you steal all its gasoline. You cannot move if you do not have any gasoline left.\nYour goal is to fill the cars in such a way that you are able to choose an optimal car, travel the clockwise distance NNN and return to the place where you were initially. Under this constraint, you want to pay the least possible number of coins.\nFind the smallest number of coins you need to pay. It is guaranteed that there is a way to travel the distance NNN. It can be proved that in such a case, the smallest number of coins is always an integer.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers f1,f2,\xe2\x80\xa6,fNf_1, f_2, \\ldots, f_Nf1\xe2\x80\x8b,f2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,fN\xe2\x80\x8b.\nThe third line contains NNN space-separated integers c1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cNc_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_Nc1\xe2\x80\x8b,c2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,cN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the smallest possible number of coins you need to pay.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\le T \\le 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4200,0001 \\le N \\le 200,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4200,000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4fi\xe2\x89\xa41090 \\le f_i \\le 10^90\xe2\x89\xa4fi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid iii\n0\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa41090 \\le c_i \\le 10^90\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid iii\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): N\xe2\x89\xa42,000N \\le 2,000N\xe2\x89\xa42,000\nSubtask #2 (90 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n3\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n3\n3 0 0\n10 0 0\n3\n3 3 3\n3 2 13\n30\n3"
