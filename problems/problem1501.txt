b"Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\n2367. The Earth.  \nThe world we know doesn't exist anymore. All has been changed during the inevitable evolution, but only Chef retains his former self.\n\nPeoples don\xe2\x80\x99t play ordinary draughts we know, mankind has enhanced it. Present games are held on an undirected graph, instead of the board. Before a game starts, one player chooses a vertex of the graph and puts a checker (called the game checker) on it. Then the players take turns alternately. In a single turn, a player moves the game checker from its current vertex, say v, to some neighbour (see note) of v. The game goes on until one of the players surrenders. The player who moves last is considered as the winner. This game may seems to you confusing. Strange even, and imperfect, but don\xe2\x80\x99t bother about it.\n\nChef would like to become the best in this game so he needs training. During training, Chef plays by himself. Being very tired, all of his moves are absolutely random as well as his choice for the initial position of the game checker. He has T game-graphs (indexed 1 to T), and a very tiresome trainer who forces him to train again and again. For the ith training session, the trainer gives 3 numbers to Chef: Li, Ri, and Ki. Chef has to carry out a few simultaneous games against himself on game-graphs indexed between Li and Ri (both included).\n\nSpecifically, after the trainer gives him such an order, for each game-graph in range Li \xe2\x80\xa6 Ri Chef randomly sets initial position of the game checker. Further, for each of the following steps, he should choose a random non-empty subset of the set of allowed game-graphs. Then he randomly moves one checker in all of these chosen game-graphs. The whole training ends after finite number of steps if the set of current positions after last step is the same as the set of initial positions. Note that Chef must make at least one move during this training.\n\nThe trainer wants Q training sessions, as described above, and for each one of them Chef would like to know how many ways of his play lead to the whole training ending within Ki steps or less. Since the answer could be very large, print it modulo 1000000007.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of graphs. The description of T graphs follows.\nThe first line of each graph description contains two integers Nk, Mk denoting the number of vertices and the number of edges in the k-th graph. Next Mk lines contain two space separated integers - 1-indexed indices of vertex pairs linked with an edge.\nIt is guaranteed that there are no multiple edges (two or more edges incident on the same two vertices) or loops (an edge connecting a vertex to itself).\n\nAfter graph descriptions, a single line contains an integer Q, denoting the number of training sessions. Each of the next Q lines contain three space-separated integers, with the ith line containing the integers Li, Ri, Ki, respectively, describing the ith training session.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each query, print a single integer - the number Chef would like to find out modulo 1000000007 (109+7).\n\nConstraints and Subtasks\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T, Nk \xe2\x89\xa4 50\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 Mk \xe2\x89\xa4 Nk\xc3\x97(Nk\xe2\x88\x921)/2\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xe2\x89\xa4 2\xc3\x97105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Li \xe2\x89\xa4 Ri \xe2\x89\xa4 T\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ki \xe2\x89\xa4 104\n\nSubtask 1: (10 points)\n\nLi = Ri\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ki \xe2\x89\xa4 100\nTime Limit is 2 seconds\n\nSubtask 2: (25 points)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ki \xe2\x89\xa4 100\nTime Limit is 2 seconds\n\nSubtask 3: (25 points)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ki \xe2\x89\xa4 2\xc3\x97103\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Nk \xe2\x89\xa4 15\nTime Limit is 8 seconds\n\nSubtask 4: (40 points)\n\n 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 20 \nTime Limit is 10 seconds\n\nExample\nInput:\n1\n3 3\n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\n3\n1 1 1\n1 1 3\n1 1 4\nOutput:\n0\n12\n30\nInput:\n2\n3 2\n1 2\n2 3\n2 1\n1 2\n3\n1 1 6\n1 2 2\n1 2 10\nOutput:\n28\n22\n915822\nExplanation\nExample case 1.\nStarts from: (ways of play with length in range [1, 4]) \n1:  (1,2,1), (1,3,1), (1,2,3,1), (1,3,2,1), (1,2,3,2,1), (1,3,2,3,1), (1,2,1,3,1),(1,3,1,2,1),(1,2,1,2,1),(1,3,1,3,1) \n2, 3:  similar to 1. \nSo, the number of ways of play with length at most 3 equals 4\xc3\x973 = 12. \nAnd, the number of ways of play with length at most 4 equals to 10\xc3\x973 = 30.\n\nExample case 2.\nStarts from: (ways of play with length = 2)\n (1,1): ((1,1), (2,1), (1,1)), ((1,1), (1,2), (1,1)), ((1,1), (2,2), (1,1)) \n (2,1): ((2,1), (1,1), (2,1)), ((2,1), (2,2), (2,1)), ((2,1), (3,1),(2,1)),\n((2,1), (1,2),(2,1)),((2,1),(3,2),(2,1))\n (3,1): similar to (1,1) \nSo, the according to symmetry of second graph number of ways equals to (3\xc3\x972+5)\xc3\x972 = 22.\n\nNote\nIn an undirected graph, a vertex u is called a neighbour of vertex v, if u and v are connected via an edge."
