b'Problem\nYou are provided with a weighted undirected graph GGG and string SSS. Each node in GGG has a letter attached to it. Find the minimum cost of a walk in GGG such that the path contains SSS as a subsequence i.e. SSS can be formed by removing 000 or more characters from the string formed by the concatenation of letters on the nodes on the walk.\nYou are allowed to begin as well as end your walk at any vertex. Also, you can visit any vertex any number of times.\nInput:\n\nFirst line contains integer TTT, representing number of test cases. Each test case is as follows.\nThe first line contains integers NNN and MMM and XXX - Number of nodes and edges  and the length of string respectively.\nThe second line contains string SSS.\nThe third line contains NNN characters. ith character represents the letter attached to the ith node.\nFollowing MMM lines contain u\xc2\xa0v\xc2\xa0wu \\  v \\  wu\xc2\xa0v\xc2\xa0w. This means uuu and vvv are connected by an edge weight www.\n\nOutput:\nOutput a single integer that represents the minimum cost of the path that contains SSS as a sub-sequence.\nIf there is no path that contains SSS as a sub-sequence then output -1.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa431 \\leq T \\leq 31\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa43\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,X\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq N, X \\leq 1000 1\xe2\x89\xa4N,X\xe2\x89\xa41000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41e30 \\leq M \\leq 1e3 0\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41e3\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq u, v \\leq N 1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\n0\xe2\x89\xa4w\xe2\x89\xa410000 \\leq w \\leq 1000 0\xe2\x89\xa4w\xe2\x89\xa41000\nNo two consecutive characters of string SSS are same.\n\nSubtasks\n\n30 points : NNN, MMM and XXX \xe2\x89\xa4100\\leq 100\xe2\x89\xa4100\n70 points : Original constraints.\n\nSample Input:\n1\n4 4 5\nababc\na b b c\n1 2 2\n1 3 1\n2 4 3\n3 4 1\nSample Output:\n4\n### EXPLANATION:\nThe path will be:\n1 - 3 - 1 - 3 - 4\n1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\n'
