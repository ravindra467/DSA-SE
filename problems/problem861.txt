b'Problem\nChefland is a 1D1D1D city where each of the NNN houses is located at a distinct positive integer coordinate A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6AN\xe2\x80\x8b. The chef is planning to create KKK hills in the city. Note that two hills cannot be present at the same location but the location of hills and houses can overlap and each hill will also be at any integer (positive, negative or zero) coordinate.\nEach citizen would want to travel to the farthest hill from his house. Travelling will create air pollution and Chef wants to minimise the total pollution in the city. Help Chef find the minimum sum of distance travelled by everyone. In other words, help Chef create the hills at optimal locations, so that the sum of the distance of every house to the hill farthest from it is minimum possible.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nEach testcase contains two lines of input.\nFirst line contains 222 integers N,KN, KN,K separated by a space.\nSecond line contains NNN integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b, representing the location of the houses.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, find the minimum possible sum of distances if Chef creates the hills at optimal locations, in a separate line.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq T \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N, K \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\nAi<Ai+1\xe2\x88\x80A_i \\lt A_{i + 1} \\forallAi\xe2\x80\x8b<Ai+1\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\x80 valid iii\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n3 1\n1 2 3\n1 5\n1\n2 2\n1 52\n2\n5\nExplanation:\nTestCase 1: Optimal solution includes creating hill at 222. Its distance from the house at coordinate 111 is 111, and so is its distance from the house at coordinate 333. Its distance from the house at coordinate 222 is 000. Thus, total distance is 1+0+1=21+0+1=21+0+1=2.\nTestCase 2: Optimal solution includes creating hills at {\xe2\x88\x921,0,1,2,3}\\{-1, 0, 1, 2, 3 \\}{\xe2\x88\x921,0,1,2,3}. The farthest hills from the house at coordinate 111 are at coordinates \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 and 333. The citizen can choose to travel to any of them, and the distance shall be 222.\nTestCase 3: Optimal solution includes creating hills at {1,2}\\{1, 2 \\}{1,2} or {4,5}\\{4, 5 \\}{4,5}.'
