Let's denote the cell in the iii-th row and jjj-th column (0\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N0 \\le i \\le N0\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N, 0\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4M0 \\le j \\le M0\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4M) by (i,j)(i, j)(i,j). The rules of the game are:\n\nAt the beginning, a stone is placed in some cell of the table.\nThe players alternate turns, Alice goes first.\nIn each turn, the current player must move the stone from its current cell (let's denote it by (x,y)(x, y)(x,y)) to the cell (x\xe2\x88\x921,y)(x-1, y)(x\xe2\x88\x921,y) or to the cell (x,y\xe2\x88\x921)(x, y-1)(x,y\xe2\x88\x921).\nAs soon as the stone is placed in a cell (x,y)(x, y)(x,y) with x=0x=0x=0 or y=0y=0y=0, the game ends.\nThe winner of the game is determined by the cell the stone ended up in and the player who moved it there; you are given this information for all possible terminal cells on the input. (Note that the stone never reaches the cell (0,0)(0, 0)(0,0).)\n\nYou should answer QQQ queries. In each query, you are given the initial position (x,y)(x, y)(x,y) of the stone, and you should determine the winner of the game.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single string with length MMM. For each iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4M1 \\le i \\le M1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4M), the iii-th digit of this string is '1' if the player that moves the stone to the cell (0,i)(0, i)(0,i) loses the game or '0' if this player wins.\nThe second line contains a single string with length NNN. For each iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le i \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the iii-th digit of this string is '1' if the player that moves the stone to the cell (i,0)(i, 0)(i,0) loses the game or '0' if this player wins.\nThe third line contains a single integer QQQ denoting the number of queries.\nEach of the following QQQ lines contains two space-separated integers xxx and yyy describing one query.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing a string with length QQQ. For each valid iii, the iii-th digit should be '1' if Alice wins the game for query iii or '0' if Bob wins that game.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M,Q\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le N, M, Q \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N,M,Q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le x \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4y\xe2\x89\xa4M1 \\le y \\le M1\xe2\x89\xa4y\xe2\x89\xa4M\nthe sum of N+M+QN+M+QN+M+Q over all test cases does not exceed 10610^6106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): the sum of N+MN+MN+M over all test cases does not exceed 10310^3103\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n101\n01\n6\n1 1\n1 2\n1 3\n2 1\n2 2\n2 3110011"
