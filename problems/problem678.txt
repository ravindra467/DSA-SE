Each job can be done only once.\nAs Phoenix is weak in calculations, can you please help him by telling how many minimum number of jobs should be done by him to earn exactly NNN dollars and not more than that?\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nEach testcase contains of a single integer NNN, representing the amount Phoenix has to earn.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line the minimum number of jobs  he need to do.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq T \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410181 \\leq N \\leq 10^{18}1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41018\n\nSample Input:\n    4\r\n    1\r\n    13\r\n    4\r\n    31\n\nSample Output:\n    1\r\n    3\r\n    1\r\n    5\n\nEXPLANATION:\nIn the first case, Phoenix will do the job paying 111 dollar which will satisfy his needs.\r\nIn the second case, Phoenix will do the jobs paying 1,41,41,4 and 888 dollars respectively."
