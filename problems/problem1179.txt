b"Problem\n\n\xe2\x80\x83 Chef and his wife Chevy are alchemists in search of the legendary Philosopher's \nStone. The Philosopher's Stone is a very powerful substance which is believed to \nhave the power to transmute precious metals, stones and even lives of living beings.\n Chef wishes to use the stone to restore his son Jim's body to its original form \nfollowing a terrifying accident in their lab.\n\n\xe2\x80\x83 It is known that Philosopher's Stones break apart into an odd number of shards\n when they're used up. After searching far and wide, Chef has collected N shards\n of what he believes to be a previously-used Philosopher's Stone, where N is an \nodd integer. He believes that fusing these shards back together will yield a \nreal stone in its entirety.\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x83 Leveraging his encyclopaedic knowledge of alchemy, Chef recalls an ancient book \nwith the following ritual for fusing shards:\n\n1.Arrange the N shards in a row, numbered from 1 to N.\n2.Note the colour Ci of each shard i, which is either auburn or black\n(denoted by the characters A and B respectively).\n3.Choose a consecutive sequence of three shards, remove them from the row,\nand fuse them together into one new shard. The three shards must not all be the same\ncolour, or such an intense concentration of similar energies will cause a\ndangerous rebound explosion. Instead, there must be two differently-coloured\nshards that will neutralise each other, get converted into energy (via the\nLaw of Equivalent Exchange), and become infused with the third shard.\nIn other words, assuming no explosion, the resulting shard's colour will be\nequal to the most common colour present amongst the three chosen shards.\n4.Place the resulting shard back into the original gap in the row, with the remaining shards\nin the same relative order before and after it.\n5.Repeat steps 3 and 4 until only one shard remains.\nNote that each time steps 3 and 4 are performed, the number of remaining shards\ndecreases by 2. Therefore, given that the initial number of shards is odd, enough\nsuccessful repetitions will result in exactly one final shard: the Philosopher's Stone.\nHelp Chef determine whether or not it's possible to get to that point and hopefully\nsave his son Jim, without causing any rebound explosions along the way.\nInput Format\n\n\nInput begins with an integer T, the number of Philosopher's Stones that Chef\ntries to reconstitute.\n\n\nFor each stone there are two lines. The first contains the integer N.\nThe second contains the length-N string C1..N.\xe2\x80\x8b\n\n\nOutput Format\n\nFor the i\xe2\x88\x92th stone, output a line containing either Y if it's possible For Chef to\nend up with the Philosopher's Stone, or N if not.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n0\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410000 \\leq T \\leq 10000\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n3\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41093 \\leq M \\leq 10^93\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4109\nCi\xe2\x88\x88{A,B}\n\n\nSubtasks\n\n\n100 points : Orignal Constraints\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput6\n3\nBAB\n3\nBBB\n5\nAABBA\n7\nBAAABAA\n11\nBBBAABAAAAB\n11\nBABBBABBABB\nY\nN\nY\nN\nY\nN\n\nExplanation:\n\n\nIn the first case, Chef is able to fuse the three shards together, as they include\ntwo differently-coloured shards, yielding a single black-coloured shard: the\nPhilosopher's Stone.\n\n\nIn the second case, the three black shards will inevitably cause a rebound explosion\nif fused.\n\n\nIn the third case, Chef can begin by fusing the first three shards into a\nsingle auburn-coloured shard. The row of shards will then feature colours ABA, and\nThose shards can be fused into the Philosopher's Stone.\n\n"
