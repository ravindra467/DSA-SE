b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nDr.D has invented yet another -inator: the hateinator. He wants to test it on a group of NNN people (numbered 111 through NNN). The hateinator may be used any number of times; to use it once, Dr.D should divide these NNN people into two groups and press the fire button on the hateinator. We call each such grouping a Doofish set. Afterwards, there will be hatred between each two people who were in different groups. The hatred does not disappear \xe2\x80\x95 any two people that hate each other before the hateinator is used still hate each other afterwards.\nThe hateinator uses a lot of power. Let's denote the number of times it is used by KKK. Then, it consumes K\xe2\x8b\x85NK \\cdot NK\xe2\x8b\x85N units of power. Dr.D cannot afford to use the hateinator if this number exceeds 10610^6106.\nDr.D has done the math and computed the most evil hatred system: a situation with some MMM pairs of people who hate each other. You are given these pairs. There must not be any other pair of people who hate each other. Initially, there is no hatred between these NNN people. Now, Dr.D is wondering: is it possible to use the hateinator to create this most evil system? If it is, what is the minimum number of times he needs to use it and with which Doofish sets? Help Dr.D find the answers.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers NNN and MMM.\nMMM lines follow. For each iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4M1 \\le i \\le M1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4M), the iii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers aia_iai\xe2\x80\x8b and bib_ibi\xe2\x80\x8b denoting that people aia_iai\xe2\x80\x8b and bib_ibi\xe2\x80\x8b should hate each other.\n\nOutput\nIf there is no way to achieve Dr.D's plan or the required amount of power exceeds 10610^6106, print a single line containing the integer \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921.\nOtherwise, first, print a line containing one integer KKK \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum number of times Dr.D needs to use the hateinator. Then, print KKK lines; each of these lines should contain a string describing a Doofish set for one use of the hateinator.\nA string SSS describes a Doofish set if it contains exactly NNN characters and each of these characters is '0' or '1'. A Doofish set is a pair of groups. For each valid iii, if the iii-th character of SSS is '1', the iii-th person is in the first group and if it is '0', this person is in the second group.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le N \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851050 \\le M \\le 2 \\cdot 10^50\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai,bi\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le a_i, b_i \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x80\x8b,bi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid iii\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask 1 (30 points): M=N\xe2\x8b\x85(N\xe2\x88\x921)/2M = N \\cdot (N - 1) / 2M=N\xe2\x8b\x85(N\xe2\x88\x921)/2\nSubtask 2 (70 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3 3\n1 2\n1 3\n2 32\n110\n100"
