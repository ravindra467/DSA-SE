b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese.\nThere are NNN guests (numbered 111 through NNN) coming to Chef's wedding. Each guest is part of a family; for each valid iii, the iii-th guest is part of family FiF_iFi\xe2\x80\x8b. You need to help Chef find an optimal seating arrangement.\nChef may buy a number of tables, which are large enough for any number of guests, but the people sitting at each table must have consecutive numbers \xe2\x80\x95 for any two guests iii and jjj (i<ji \\lt ji<j) sitting at the same table, guests i+1,i+2,\xe2\x80\xa6,j\xe2\x88\x921i+1, i+2, \\ldots, j-1i+1,i+2,\xe2\x80\xa6,j\xe2\x88\x921 must also sit at that table. Chef would have liked to seat all guests at a single table; however, he noticed that two guests iii and jjj are likely to get into an argument if Fi=FjF_i = F_jFi\xe2\x80\x8b=Fj\xe2\x80\x8b and they are sitting at the same table.\nEach table costs KKK rupees. Chef defines the inefficiency of a seating arrangement as the total cost of tables plus the number of guests who are likely to get into an argument with another guest. Tell Chef the minimum possible inefficiency which he can achieve.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and KKK.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers F1,F2,\xe2\x80\xa6,FNF_1, F_2, \\ldots, F_NF1\xe2\x80\x8b,F2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,FN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the smallest possible inefficiency.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le T \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le N \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le K \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Fi\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le F_i \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4Fi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4100 for each valid iii\nThe sum of NNN across test cases is \xe2\x89\xa45,000\\leq 5,000\xe2\x89\xa45,000\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 (20 points): K=1K = 1K=1\nSubtask #2 (80 points): original constraints\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n5 1\n5 1 3 3 3\n5 14\n1 4 2 4 4\n5 2\n3 5 4 5 13\n17\n4\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: The optimal solution is to use three tables with groups of guests [1,2,3][1, 2, 3][1,2,3], [4][4][4] and [5][5][5]. None of the tables have any guests that are likely to get into an argument, so the inefficiency is 3\xe2\x8b\x85K=33 \\cdot K = 33\xe2\x8b\x85K=3.\nExample case 2: The optimal solution is to seat all guests at one table. Then, guests 222, 444 and 555 are likely to get into an argument with each other, so the inefficiency is K+3=17K + 3 = 17K+3=17."
