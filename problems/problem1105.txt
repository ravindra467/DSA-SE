b'Problem\nChef likes to spend his summer vacation playing with strings. Chef likes alternating patterns, but he only likes the characters a\\texttt{a}a and b\\texttt{b}b, so he does the following:\nChef starts with an empty string SSS. Then,\n\nFirst, he appends a\\texttt{a}a once to SSS\nNext, he appends b\\texttt{b}b twice to SSS\nNext, he appends a\\texttt{a}a thrice to SSS\nNext, he appends b\\texttt{b}b four times to SSS\n\nand so on. For example, the first 131313 characters of SSS are abbaaabbbbaaa\\texttt{abbaaabbbbaaa}abbaaabbbbaaa.\nNow, Chef takes the string formed by the first NNN characters of SSS, and wants to calculate its beauty. The beauty of a string is calculated as follows:\n\nFirst, we define the value of a string AAA to be the number of positions 1\xe2\x89\xa4i<\xe2\x88\xa3A\xe2\x88\xa31 \\leq i \\lt |A|1\xe2\x89\xa4i<\xe2\x88\xa3A\xe2\x88\xa3 such that Ai\xe2\x89\xa0Ai+1A_i \\neq A_{i+1}Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xee\x80\xa0=Ai+1\xe2\x80\x8b. For example, the value of aaa\\texttt{aaa}aaa is 000 and the value of abba\\texttt{abba}abba is 222.\nThen, the beauty of a string is defined to be the sum of values of all its substrings. Two substrings are considered distinct if they occur at different positions, so every string of length KKK has exactly K\xe2\x8b\x85(K+1)/2K\\cdot(K+1)/2K\xe2\x8b\x85(K+1)/2 substrings.\n\nYou are given NNN. Help Chef by calculating the beauty of the string formed by the first NNN characters of SSS. The answer may be large, so report it modulo 100000000710000000071000000007.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input will contain a single integer TTT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output in a single line the beauty of the string modulo 109+710^9 + 7109+7.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq T \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq N \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n3\n4\n72\n6\n24\nExplanation:\nTest case 111: The first three characters of SSS are abb\\texttt{abb}abb. The values of the substrings are as follows:\n\na,b,b,bb\\texttt{a}, \\texttt{b}, \\texttt{b}, \\texttt{bb}a,b,b,bb have a value of 000.\nab,abb\\texttt{ab}, \\texttt{abb}ab,abb have a value of 111.\n\nSo, the beauty of the string is 222.\nTest case 222: The first 444 characters of SSS are abba\\texttt{abba}abba. Its substrings of non-zero value are:\n\nab,abb,ba,bba\\texttt{ab}, \\texttt{abb}, \\texttt{ba}, \\texttt{bba}ab,abb,ba,bba with value 111\nabba\\texttt{abba}abba with value 222.\n\nSo, the beauty of the string is 1+1+1+1+2=61 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 61+1+1+1+2=6.'
