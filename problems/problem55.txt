b'Problem\nKulyash has given you an array AAA of size NNN.\nHe defines the subsequence-number of a non-empty subsequence\nSSS of array AAA as the number formed by the concatenation of all the elements of the subsequence SSS.\nFind the count of non-empty subsequences of AAA having their subsequence-numbers divisible by 777. Since the answer can be huge, output it modulo 109+710^9 + 7109+7.\nFor example: Consider A=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]A=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]. A subsequence SSS of AAA is [2,5,7,10][2, 5, 7, 10][2,5,7,10]. The subsequence-number of this subsequence is 257102571025710.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line will contain TTT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer NNN, the size of the array.\nThe second line of each test case contains NNN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x94 the elements of the array AAA.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output in a single line the number of subsequences with subsequence-number divisible by 777 modulo 100000000710000000071000000007.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq T \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851051 \\leq N \\leq 3\\cdot 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x851051 \\leq A_i \\leq 3\\cdot 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa43\xe2\x8b\x85105\nSum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x851053\\cdot 10^53\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n2\n1 2\n4\n1 2 3 4\n2\n7 7\n0\n1\n3\n\nExplanation:\nTest case 111: Only 333 subsequences are possible for the given array. These are [1][1][1], [1,2][1, 2][1,2], and [2][2][2]. The subsequence-numbers are 111, 121212, and 222 respectively. None of the subsequence-numbers are divisible by 777, so the answer is 000.\nTest case 222: [1,4][1, 4][1,4] is the only subsequence having its subsequence-number 141414 which is divisible by 777. So, the answer is 111.\nTest case 333: All the non-empty subsequences [7][7][7], [7][7][7], and [7,7][7, 7][7,7] have their subsequence-numbers 7,7,7, 7,7,7, and 777777 divisible by 777. So, the answer is 333.'
