Help Chef to find this number.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will consist of two integers NNN and KKK.\nNNN lines follow, each containing a string SiS_iSi\xe2\x80\x8b consisting of uppercase letters .\n\nOutput:\nPrint a single integer containing the maximum number of groups that can be formed.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\leq N \\leq 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\leq K \\leq 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Si\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\leq S_i \\leq 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4Si\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4103\n\nSample input:\n9 3  \r\nAPPLE  \r\nANT  \r\nALPHABET  \r\nBLOCK  \r\nBULL  \r\nBOSS  \r\nCAT  \r\nDOLL  \r\nEGG  \n\nSample Output:\n3\n\nSample input:\n3 2  \r\nCAR  \r\nCAT  \r\nCLOTHES  \n\nSample Output:\n0\n\nEXPLANATION:\n\nFor the first input, 3 groups of size 3 can be made.
