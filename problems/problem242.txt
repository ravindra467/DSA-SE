b"Problem\nNeil has a perfect binary tree with NNN nodes, and an integer MMM. He can assign values to nodes. He calls the tree good if the following conditions are met:\n\nNodes' values are positive integers no more than MMM.\nNodes at even levels have values strictly more than their parents' values.\nNodes at odd levels have values strictly less than their parents's values.\n\nHow many ways can Neil assign values to all nodes to get a good perfect binary tree? Since the answer can be large, please output it under modulo 109+710^9 + 7109+7.\nNote:\n\nThe root of the tree is at layer 111.\nTwo assignments are different if there is at least one node with different values in both assignments.\nYou may need to use 64-bit data types in your programming language to take input.\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of each input contains TTT - the number of test cases. The test cases then follow.\nThe only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and MMM - the number of nodes on the tree and the maximum value of any node.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output on a single line the number of different assignment modulo 109+710^9 + 7109+7.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq T \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq M \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N<2591 \\leq N \\lt 2^{59}1\xe2\x89\xa4N<259\nIt is guaranteed you can make a perfect binary tree with exactly NNN nodes.\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n3 3\n5\nExplanation:\n\nTest case 111: Here are all the possible assignments.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
