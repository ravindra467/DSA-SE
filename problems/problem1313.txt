b'Problem\nRocky loves watching the stars of the night sky. He has a telescope with a range length LLL whose stand is damaged in such a way that you can\xe2\x80\x99t move the telescope up, down, left or right. It can point only to a fixed point in the sky. Rocky likes to watch as many stars as possible. So, he got an idea and made a slider for the base of the stand. But the slider was too slippery, so you have to fix the telescope to view through it. Given NNN stars and their coordinates on the horizontal line of vision of the telescope, can you help Rocky find the position to fix the telescope such that he can watch maximum number of stars?\n[Note: Range length LLL of the telescope is defined as, if you fix the telescope such that the left endpoint is at coordinate xxx on the horizontal line of vision, then Rocky can see all stars in the range xxx to x+Lx+Lx+L, inclusive of endpoints.\nInput:\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN, LLL.\nThe second line contains NNN space separated integers X1,X2,\xe2\x80\xa6.XNX_1, X_2, \xe2\x80\xa6. X_NX1\xe2\x80\x8b,X2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6.XN\xe2\x80\x8b, where XiX_iXi\xe2\x80\x8b denotes the xxx-coordinate of the ithi^{th}ith star. (As you can see, the yyy-coordinate is irrelevant, as all are along the same line)\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, print a single line containing two space separated integers AAA, XXX,  where AAA denotes the maximum stars possible to see when the telescope is fixed, and XXX denotes the xxx-coordinate of the left part of the range of the telescope.\nIf there are multiple answers with the same highest no. of stars, print the highest xxx-coordinate among them.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq T \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq L \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\xe2\x88\xa3Xi\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4109|X_i| \\leq 10^9\xe2\x88\xa3Xi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSample Input:\n2\n5 2\n0 1 2 4 5\n5 4\n-15 6 -11  -2 1\n\nSample Output:\n3 0\n2 -2\n'
