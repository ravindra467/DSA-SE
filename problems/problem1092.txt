b"Problem\nAlisha has a string of length n. Each character is either 'a', 'b' or 'c'. She has to select two characters s[i] and s[j] such that s[i] != s[j] and i,j are valid indexes. She has to find the maximum value of the absolute difference between i and j i.e abs(i-j) .\nSince Alisha is busy with her Semester exams help her find the maximum distance where distance is the maximum value of absolute difference between i and j  i.e abs(i-j) .\nInput:\n\nThe first and the only line contains the string s with each character either 'a', 'b', or 'c'.\n\nOutput:\nPrint a single integer the maximum absolute difference between i and j.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq n \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105\ns[i] can either be 'a', 'b' or 'c'.\n\nSubtasks\n\n40 points : 1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq n \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100\n60 points : 1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq n \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\nSample Input1:\naabcaaa\n\nSample Output1:\n4\n\nSample Input2:\naba\n\nSample Output2:\n1\n"
