b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nGleb is trying to solve the P versus NP problem, so he is doing some research now. He does not have time to solve boring and easy problems like this one, so he gave it to you.\nYou are given a connected undirected graph with NNN vertices labelled 111 through NNN and a number KKK. You have to solve exactly one of the following two problems or determine that both of them have no solution (if both have a solution, you are free to choose either one of them to solve):\n\nFind a cut in the graph with size strictly smaller than KKK. A cut is a partition of vertices of the graph into two non-empty subsets AAA and BBB (A\xe2\x88\xa9B=\xe2\x88\x85A \\cap B = \\emptysetA\xe2\x88\xa9B=\xe2\x88\x85, \xe2\x88\xa3A\xe2\x88\xa3+\xe2\x88\xa3B\xe2\x88\xa3=N|A| + |B| = N\xe2\x88\xa3A\xe2\x88\xa3+\xe2\x88\xa3B\xe2\x88\xa3=N). The size of a cut is the number of edges (u,v)(u, v)(u,v) such that u\xe2\x88\x88Au \\in Au\xe2\x88\x88A and v\xe2\x88\x88Bv \\in Bv\xe2\x88\x88B.\nFind a simple cycle in the graph with size at least KKK (containing at least KKK vertices). A simple cycle does not visit any edge more than once and does not visit any vertex more than once.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NNN, MMM and KKK.\nEach of the following MMM lines contains two space-separated integers uuu and vvv describing an edge between vertices uuu and vvv.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case:\n\nIf both problems have no solution, print a single line containing the string "NO ANSWER".\nOtherwise, print three lines. The first line should contain the string "CUT" if you solved the first problem or "CYCLE" if you solved the second problem.\nIf you solved the first problem, the second line should contain a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the size of the set AAA, and the third line should contain \xe2\x88\xa3A\xe2\x88\xa3|A|\xe2\x88\xa3A\xe2\x88\xa3 space-separated integers denoting the labels of vertices in the set AAA.\nIf you solved the second problem, the second line should contain a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the size SSS of the simple cycle you found, and the third line should contain SSS space-separated integers denoting the vertices of the cycle in an order in which they appear on the cycle.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le T \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851052 \\le N, M \\le 2 \\cdot 10^52\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n3\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N3 \\le K \\le N3\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le u, v \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\nu\xe2\x89\xa0vu \\neq vu\xee\x80\xa0=v for each edge\nthere are no two edges connecting the same pair of vertices\nthe graph described on the input is connected\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052 \\cdot 10^52\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of MMM over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052 \\cdot 10^52\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (40 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\le N \\le 101\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410\nSubtask #2 (60 points): original constraints\nExample Input\n2\n8 7 3\n1 4\n2 4\n3 4\n4 5\n5 6\n5 7\n5 8\n3 3 3\n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\n\nExample Output\nCUT\n4\n1 2 3 4\nCYCLE\n3\n1 2 3\n'
