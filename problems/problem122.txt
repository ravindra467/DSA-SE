b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nWe say that a binary string (a string containing only characters \'0\' and \'1\') is pure if it does not contain either of the strings "0101" or "1010" as a subsequence.\nRecall that string T is a subsequence of string S if we can delete some of the letters of S (possibly none) such that the resulting string will become T.\nYou are given a binary string SSS with length NNN. We want to make this string pure by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from it. What is the minimum number of characters we have to delete?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single string SSS with length NNN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of characters we have to delete from SSS.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4401 \\le T \\le 401\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa440\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le N \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nSSS contains only characters \'0\' and \'1\'\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4\n010111101\n1011100001011101\n0110\n1111112\n3\n0\n0\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: We can delete the first and third character of our string. There is no way to make the string pure by deleting only one character.\nExample case 3: The given string is already pure, so the answer is zero.'
