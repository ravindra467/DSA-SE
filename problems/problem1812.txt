b"Problem\n\nProblem:\nYou are going to your college via bike/scooter/car. You need to increase your speed to reach the college as soon as possible. Your speed right now is divided into NNN parts with their values S(i)S(i)S(i) (given).\nYou can increase your speed XXX number of times by increasing any value by S(i)/2S(i)/2S(i)/2. Consider floor value if the speed is odd.\nYou always try to increase the speed very few times and speed to be high.\nYou can't change the speed more than NNN times and can't change the same speed again.\nFinally, you need to maintain the total speed  \xe2\x89\xa540\\geq 40 \xe2\x89\xa540 to reach the college on time.\nPrint minimum number of times you need to change the speed, total speed, YES if you can reach the college on time else NO.\n\nINPUT:\n\nFirst-line contains TTT denoting number of test cases.\n\nNext TTT lines contains NNN  along with S(i)S(i)S(i) values as described above separated by space.\n\nOUTPUT:\n\nFor every case print the minimum number of times you need to change the speed, total speed, YES if you can reach the college on time else NO. separated by space in a single line.\n\nConstraints:\n\n0<TTT<20\n\n\n0<NNN<100\n\n\n0<S(i)S(i)S(i)<200\n\nSample Input:\n\n2\n4 1 2 3 4\n5 10 15 10 1 2\n\nSample Output:\n\n4 14 NO\n1 45 YES\n\nEXPLANATION:\n\n\nIn the first case, his/her speed got divided into 4 speeds as 1 2 3 4. even though he increased all the speeds as described his total speed is still 14 which is not sufficient to reach the college on time.   \n\n\nIn the second case, he/she increases 15 as described total speed became maximum and it is more than the required speed to reach the college on time."
