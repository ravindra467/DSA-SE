b"Problem\nIt's late at night, and the college students are required to return to their college hostels from the hostel garden.\nThe hostel garden is a rectangular field of dimensions N\xc3\x97MN \\times MN\xc3\x97M, with two hostels \xe2\x80\x94 one across the left edge and one across the top edge of the field.\nStudents are currently in the cells of the field. You are given two matrices of size N\xc3\x97MN \\times MN\xc3\x97M, AAA and BBB. Ai,jA_{i, j}Ai,j\xe2\x80\x8b denotes the number of students currently in the ithi^{th}ith row and the jthj^{th}jth column of the field who want to reach the hostel along the left edge of the field, and similarly Bi,jB_{i, j}Bi,j\xe2\x80\x8b denotes the number of students currently in the ithi^{th}ith row and the jthj^{th}jth column of the field who want to reach the hostel along the top edge of the field.\nStudents will always move toward their respective hostels as a straight path from their positions (so the students represented by AAA will always move straight left, and those represented by BBB will always move straight up), and are allowed to enter the hostel from any cell adjacent to the edge of the field (i.e., there are no specific entry points for the hostels).\nThere is only one restriction: there should not exist two students such that one of them reaches the left-edge hostel, the other one reaches the top-edge hostel, and the paths followed by these two students intersect.\nFor example, it is not allowed for a student in cell (1,5)(1, 5)(1,5) to go left and a student in cell (28,3)(28, 3)(28,3) to go up, because their paths would intersect at cell (1,3)(1, 3)(1,3).\nUnder this restriction, what is the maximum number of students who can reach their hostels?\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input will contain a single integer TTT, the number of test cases. Then the testcases follow.\nEach test case consists of multiple lines of input.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N,MN, MN,M.\nThe next NNN lines describe the matrix AAA. The iii-th of these NNN lines contains MMM space-separated integers Ai,1,Ai,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ai,MA_{i, 1}, A_{i, 2}, \\ldots, A_{i, M}Ai,1\xe2\x80\x8b,Ai,2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ai,M\xe2\x80\x8b\nThe next NNN lines describe the matrix BBB. The iii-th of these NNN lines contains MMM space-separated integers Bi,1,Bi,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Bi,MB_{i, 1}, B_{i, 2}, \\ldots, B_{i, M}Bi,1\xe2\x80\x8b,Bi,2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,Bi,M\xe2\x80\x8b\n\n\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output in a single line the maximum number of students who can reach their hostels.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\leq T \\leq 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\leq N, M \\leq 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4106\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,j<1090 \\leq A_{i, j} \\lt 10^90\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,j\xe2\x80\x8b<109\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Bi,j<1090 \\leq B_{i, j} \\lt 10^90\xe2\x89\xa4Bi,j\xe2\x80\x8b<109\nThe sum of N\xc3\x97MN\\times MN\xc3\x97M over all test cases does not exceed 10610^6106\n\n\nSubtasks\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n1 3\n6 7 0\n9 1 0\n2 2\n89 0\n67 99\n12 44\n23 5413\n299\n\nExplanation:\nTest case 111: It is optimal to move all students of the left-edge hostel, hence the answer is 6+7+0=136+7+0=136+7+0=13.\nTest case 222: It is optimal to move the students of (row, column)=(1,2)(1,2)(1,2) to the top-edge hostel, and students from the remaining cells to move to the left-edge hostel, therefore the answer is 44+89+67+99=29944+89+67+99=29944+89+67+99=299."
