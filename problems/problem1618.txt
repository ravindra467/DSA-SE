b'Problem\nApocalypse is about to happen in one day. New World will begin after one day in Winden! Jonas is the only person who knew about this. He also knew that those who stay in the bunker will live and proceed to the new world. Others will be dead after apocalypse happens.\nJonas wants to save his crush, Martha. He wants to send a message to her. However, Adam is a villain here. If Jonas sends a plain text message, Adam will modify it. Jonas knows about Adam, so he is going to send an encrypted message using KKK-strong key.\nJonas has a string containing NNN lower case English letters, which he can use to make a key. He can use any character from string at most once in any order to make a key. A key of length MMM is KKK-strong if for any index 0\xe2\x89\xa4i<0 \\le i \\lt0\xe2\x89\xa4i< M ,character at index iii and index (i+K)%M(i+K) \\% {M}(i+K)%M should be the same. Jonas wants it to make it the longest possible string so that Bruteforce Attack can\'t easily predict it. Can you help Jonas to find the maximum length of a KKK-strong key he can make?.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. Then TTT test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains integers NNN and KKK. Second line contains a string SSS  containing NNN lower case English letters.\nOutput\nFor each case, print the maximum length of KKK-strong key you can make.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le T \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa42,0001 \\le N, K \\le 2,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa42,000\nThe sum of NNN for all test cases does not exceed 200020002000\n\nExample Input\n3\r\n4 8\r\nbbbb\r\n8 4\r\nabcddcba\r\n6 1\r\nababab\r\n20 7\r\nqwnfdnjppcerjbsuatrl  \n\nExample Output\n4\r\n8\r\n3\r\n7\n\nExplanation\nCase 1: \xe2\x80\x9cbbbb\xe2\x80\x9d is maximum possible 8- strong key.\nCase 2: \xe2\x80\x9cabcdabcd\xe2\x80\x9d is maximum possible 4- strong key.\nCase 3:  "aaa" and "bbb" are possible strings for 1-strong key.'
