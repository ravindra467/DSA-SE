b'Problem\nSereja has n boxes with balloons. Boxes are numbered with integers from 1 to n. The first box contains a[1] balloons,    the second- a[2] balloons and so on.Also Sereja wrote down m pairs of the number (l[1],\xe2\x80\x89r[1]), (l[2],\xe2\x80\x89r[2]), ..., (l[m],\xe2\x80\x89r[m]) on a piece of paper. Now    Sereja decided to play and began to burst the balloons in the boxes. At every step Sereja bursts one balloon from    some box and wants to know : what is the count of the indices i (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89i\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89m), that all balloons in the boxes with the    indices from l[i] to r[i] are already bursted.Please, help Sereja.InputThe first line contains numbers n and m \xe2\x80\x94 the number of the boxes and the number of the pair of numbers. The next    line contains n integers a[1], a[2], ..., a[n].The following m lines contain m pairs of numbers (l[1],\xe2\x80\x89r[1]), (l[2],\xe2\x80\x89r[2]), ..., (l[m],\xe2\x80\x89r[m]).The next line contains number k \xe2\x80\x94 the number of times, when Sereja had his balloon bursted. The next  k line contains    integers x[1], x[2], ..., x[k]. Index of the box, in what Sereja bursted a balloon at the step number i (1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89i\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89k),    is denoted as y[i]., which can be found as: y[i]\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89x[i]\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x89ans[i\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891], wherein ans[0]\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890, \xd0\xb0nd ans[i] (i>0) \xe2\x80\x94 is the    answer on the problem after ith bursting of the balloons.OutputFor each test case, print k lines \xe2\x80\x94 the answers after every steps.Constraints 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n,\xe2\x80\x89m \xe2\x89\xa4 10^5 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 a[i] \xe2\x89\xa4 100000 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 l[i] \xe2\x89\xa4 r[i] \xe2\x89\xa4 nExampleInput:\n5 3\n1 1 1 1 1\n5 5\n2 2\n1 3\n5\n4\n2\n0\n2\n3\nOutput:\n0\n1\n1\n2\n3\n\nUpdate:\nYou may assume that, y[i] <= n and k <= 100000'
