b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\n\nChef has always dreamed of becoming an employee of the "Hack and Manipulate Group". Their work is simple \xe2\x80\x95 attacking networks. They gave Chef the following task to assess his programming skills, but Chef is too busy cooking "Vegetable Gourmet". Can you solve the task for him?\nA network consists of NNN nodes (numbered 111 through NNN) and MMM bidirectional connections between pairs of these nodes. A robust network is a network that contains a cycle. Shutting down a node means removing that node (and all direct connections it is part of) from the network.\nYou may shut down at most one node. If the network was robust before it was shut down and is not robust afterwards, this node is called the point of failure.\nIs the initial network robust? If it is robust, does it have a point of failure? If it does, find the point of failure with the smallest number.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and MMM.\nEach of the following MMM lines contains two space-separated integers uuu and vvv denoting that nodes uuu and vvv are directly connected.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the smallest number of a point of failure, or \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 if the network does not have a point of failure.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\le T \\le 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le N \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41050 \\le M \\le 10^50\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le u, v \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points):\n\nN\xe2\x89\xa4100N \\le 100N\xe2\x89\xa4100\nN\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4N+1N - 1 \\le M \\le N + 1N\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4N+1\nthe given graph is connected\n\nSubtask #2 (10 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le N \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\nSubtask #3 (30 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le N \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nSubtask #4 (50 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput5\n5 5\n5 1\n5 2\n1 2\n2 3\n2 4\n5 6\n4 5\n4 1\n4 2\n4 3\n5 1\n5 2\n5 5\n3 4\n3 5\n3 1\n3 2\n4 2\n4 1\n3 4\n6 6\n1 2\n2 3\n3 1\n4 5\n5 6\n6 41\n4\n2\n-1\n-1'
