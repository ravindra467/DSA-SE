b'Problem\nDuring world war 111, there were NNN cities and MMM roads connecting cities in a country. Each jthj^{th}jth road in the country is of particular distance DjD_jDj\xe2\x80\x8b and each ithi^{th}ith city has population AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b.\nThere was a secret message of the enemy intercepted which tells that enemy is going to attack the roads of the country. If an enemy attacks a particular road then that road becomes unusable.\nLet us say that those roads which do not stop movement from one city to another if they are destroyed are called strong roads. In other words, a road is called strong road if after removal of only this road out of MMM roads in graph there remains a path between any two cities. Roads which are not strong are referred as weak roads.\nEnemy is going to destroy all the weak roads of a country. Cities which are connected to at least KKK strong roads are called strong cities and rest are weak cities. Government decided to move all citizens which are in weak cities to strong cities.\nFor each weak city, find out the distance to nearest strong city. Find sum of all such distances. If there does not exist a path to strong city from some weak city then the population of this weak citiy cannot be saved from enemy attack. Find the sum of population which cannot be saved from enemy attack.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x971051 \\leq M \\leq 2*10^51\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x97105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x971051 \\leq K \\leq 2*10^51\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x97105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Di\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq D_i \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4Di\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\nInput Format\n\nFirst line contains 3 space seperated integers NNN MMM KKK\nThe Second Line contains NNN space seperated integers where ithi^{th}ith element denotes the population of ithi^{th}ith city.\nMMM lines, each line containing 3 space seperated integers xxx, yyy, DiD_iDi\xe2\x80\x8b which means there is a road from xxx to yyy with DiD_iDi\xe2\x80\x8b distance. (xxx != yyy).\n\nOutput Format\n\nTwo  space seperated integers AAA and BBB\nWhere AAA denotes the total distance to be calculated as explained above.\nWhere BBB denotes the total population to be calculated as explained above.\n\nSample Input\n5 6 3\n3 9 11 28 41\n1 4 2\n1 3 5\n1 2 3\n2 3 7\n3 4 9\n4 5 1\nSample Output\n5 41\nExplanation\nThe road between 444 and 555 is weak road as if it is removed there is no path to go from 444 to 555. Rest all roads are strong roads. 444 and 222 are weak cities as they have only 2 strong roads which is less than K=3K=3K=3. 111 and 333 are strong cities as both of them have 3 strong roads. Therefore, after removing weak roads, there is no path to any strong city from weak city 555. Hence required sum of population is 414141. 222 is a weak city with nearest strong city 111 at a distance of 333. 444 is a weak city with nearest strong city 111 at a distance of 222. Therefore, sum of distances is 333 +++ 222 === 555.\n'
