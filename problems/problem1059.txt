b'Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nA palindrome is a string that reads same in both directions: forwards and backwards. For example, the strings radar and noon are palindromes, whereas the string chef is not a palindrome as being read backwards is becomes equal to fehc, which is not equal to chef.\nLet\'s say that the pair of indices (i, j) denotes a palindrome in some string S iff i \xe2\x89\xa4 j and the substring starting at the i-th character and ending at the j-th character of S is a palindrome.\nGiven an integer N. Your task is to construct a string S such that there are exactly N different pairs (i, j) that denotes a palindrome.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the sought number of pairs that denote palindrome. \nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing a string S, consisting of lowecase Latin letters, and having exactly N distinct palindrome-denoting pairs. If there\'s a few such strings, output any one.\nIf such string S doesn\'t exist, output -1 instead of it.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 104\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n6\n7\n2\n\nOutput:\nnoon\nradar\nab\nExplanation\nExample case 1. In the string "noon", the pairs that denote a palindrome are (1-indexed): (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 4).\nExample case 2. In the string "radar", the pairs that denote a palindrome are (1-indexed): (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5).\nExample case 3. In the string "ab", the pairs denoting a palindrome are : (1, 1), (2, 2)'
