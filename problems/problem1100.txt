b'Problem\nHow many times does the integer K occur in the sequence obtained by writing out all the natural numbers from 1 to N, without any whitespace in between.\nFor example, if N = 20, the sequence would look like\n1234567891011121314151617181920\n\n\nIn the above sequence, the integer 12 occurs exactly 2 times. Also, the integer 11 appears exactly 2 times. Note that the two occurances of 11 overlap, but should still be counted separately.\nInput\nThe first line of input consists of an integer T - the number of the test cases. Then, T lines, consisting of two integers N and K follow. N and K are separated by a single space.\nOutput\nFor every test case, output the number of times that the integer K appears in the string, obtained by writing out the first N natural numbers.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, K \xe2\x89\xa4 1000000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Sum of N over all the test cases \xe2\x89\xa4 1000000\n\nSample Input\n5\n100 333\n97 5\n4 5\n11 1\n10 1\n\nSample Output\n1\n20\n0\n4\n2\n'
