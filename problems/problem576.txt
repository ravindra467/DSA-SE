b"Problem\nIIIT administration is always very hungry for money and they've now decided to mine their playground to look for hidden gold. Of course, they are very lazy and have handed it over to you as a part of Social Community service.\nYou have 222 types of mining bombs (in unlimited quantity) and you have to mine a row of size 1\xe2\x88\x97N1 * N1\xe2\x88\x97N (you can say NNN cells), drawn on the ground (of course, other areas are mined by other students and their work will not affect your row, so you\nshouldn't be bothered with them).\nBut the mining bombs are of very cheap quality, obviously as expected from the administration.\n\nThe 1st type of bombs mine only the cell they are dropped and the very next cell on the right.\nThe 2nd type of bombs mine only the cell they are dropped and the very next two cells on the right.\n\nYou are not allowed to drop a bomb at a position which is already mined as the administration wants all gold for themselves and they think, if an area is mined twice the gold may be exposed and you may take some of it.\nAlso, you cannot drop a bomb at a position if its mining range goes out of the NNN cells, else it will affect the nearby hostels.\nYou need to find the number of ways you can mine the row allotted to you with the given types of bombs.\nAs the final answer may be too long, you are required to output the answer modulo 1000000007 (109+710^9 + 7109+7).\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nEach test case contains a single integer NNN.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output an integer in a new line, the number of ways you can mine the row modulo 1000000007.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4501 \\leq T \\leq 501\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa450\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x88\x971081 \\leq N \\leq 5 * 10^81\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x88\x97108\n\nSample Input:\n2\n5\n\n1\nSample Output:\n2\n\n0\n### EXPLANATION:\nFor the 1st test case:\nWe have a row of 5 cells.\nSo we can drop a bomb of 1st type in the 1st cell. As a result, cells 1 and 2 will be mined. Now we can drop a bomb of 2nd type in the 3rd cell. As a result, cells 3, 4 and 5 will be mined.\nAnother way of mining is we can drop a bomb of 2nd type in the 1st cell. As a result, cells 1, 2 and 3 will be mined. Now we can drop a bomb of 1st type in the 4th cell. As a result, cells 4 and 5 will be mined.\nThus we have total 2 ways to mine the row.\nFor the 2nd test case:\nWe have a row of 1 cell. So we can't drop any type of bomb as they will affect the area outside the cell too."
