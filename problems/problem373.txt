b"Problem\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nTwo of your friends (let's denote them by PPP and QQQ) are playing a game and you are acting as their dealer. The rules of the game are as follows:\n\nThere are NNN bracket sequences, denoted by S1,S2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SNS_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_NS1\xe2\x80\x8b,S2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,SN\xe2\x80\x8b.\nInitially, both players do not have any sequences. They play up to NNN turns. For each valid iii, in the iii-th turn, you have to choose one player and give the bracket sequence SiS_iSi\xe2\x80\x8b to this player.\nAfter each turn, if it is possible to arrange all the sequences of one player in some order and concatenate them in such a way that the resulting bracket sequence is non-empty and balanced, that player immediately wins and the game ends. Note that it is impossible for both players to form non-empty balanced sequences at the same time.\n\nYou like PPP more and hence want PPP to win. Find the smallest number of turns you need in order to make PPP win or determine that it is impossible to achieve this.\nNotes:\n\nA bracket sequence is an arbitrary string containing only characters '(' and ')'.\nA balanced bracket sequence is one of the following:\n\nAn empty string.\nA concatenation of two non-empty balanced bracket sequences.\nA string formed by adding '(' to the beginning and ')' to the end of a balanced bracket sequence.\n\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nNNN lines follow. For each valid iii, the iii-th of these lines contains a single string SiS_iSi\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the smallest number of turns needed to make PPP win or \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4151 \\le T \\le 151\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa415\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42001 \\le N \\le 2001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4200\n1\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3Si\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa42001 \\le |S_i| \\le 2001\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3Si\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4200 for each valid iii\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n4\n())\n((\n()))\n()((3\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: You can give S1S_1S1\xe2\x80\x8b to QQQ and S2S_2S2\xe2\x80\x8b and S3S_3S3\xe2\x80\x8b to PPP."
