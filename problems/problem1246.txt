b'Problem\n Read problems statements in Russian here\nThe Head Chef has been playing with Fibonacci numbers for long . He has learnt several tricks related to Fibonacci numbers . Now he wants to test his chefs in the skills .  \nA fibonacci number is defined by the recurrence : \nf(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) for n > 2 and f(1) = 0 and f(2) = 1 .  \nGiven a number  A   , determine if it is a fibonacci number.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe only line of each test case contains a single integer  A  denoting the number to be checked .\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing "YES" if the given number is a fibonacci number , otherwise output a single line containing "NO" . \nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 number of digits in A  \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n  The sum of number of digits in A in all test cases   <= 10000.  \n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n3\n4\n5YES\nNO\nYES\nExplanation:\nExample case 1. The first few fibonacci numbers are 0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 ,5 , 8 , 13 and so on and the series is increasing . Only 3 and 5 appear in this series while 4 does not appear in the series . '
