b"Problem\nYou are given NNN and there exists an array of NNN items, which only the Chef knows. The i-th item of the array will have a weight (WiW_iWi\xe2\x80\x8b) and a profit (PiP_iPi\xe2\x80\x8b) value associated with it.\nYou are allowed to ask the chef the value of dp[i][j]dp[i][j]dp[i][j], for a given i,ji, ji,j where dp[i][j]dp[i][j]dp[i][j] denotes the maximum amount of profit you can earn if you pick the best subset of items from the first iii items of the array such that the sum of the weights of the picked items doesn't exceed jjj.\nYour aim is to determine the weight and profit of each item, i.e recover the WWW and PPP array.\nYou are allowed to query at most 150015001500 times.\nInteraction\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer NNN, denoting the number of items in the array.\nYou need to print to the standard output, for the operations you wish to perform. There are two types of operations:\nIn the first type, you are asking the judge the value of dp[i][j]dp[i][j]dp[i][j]. You need to print a single line with 111 iii jjj, where the judge will return a single value by printing the integer in the standard input. It will be the value of dp[i][j]dp[i][j]dp[i][j].\nIn the second type, you are telling the judge the answer. For each test case, you should perform this operation exactly once at the end. This operation is not taken into account when counting the number of queries done.You need to print 333 lines:\nThe first line starts with 222, denoting the type of query.\nThe second line consists of NNN integers denoting the WWW weights array in the format W1W_1W1\xe2\x80\x8b W2W_2W2\xe2\x80\x8b W3W_3W3\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\xa6\\dots\xe2\x80\xa6 WNW_NWN\xe2\x80\x8b.\nThe third line consists of NNN integers denoting the PPP profits array in the format P1P_1P1\xe2\x80\x8b P2P_2P2\xe2\x80\x8b P3P_3P3\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\xa6\\dots\xe2\x80\xa6 PNP_NPN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nNote\nDon't forget to flush the standard output after printing each line. It can be done using fflush(stdout) in C/C++, System.out.flush() in Java and sys.stdout.flush() in Python.\nIf you exceed 150015001500 queries OR If in the first type of query, iii and jjj don't satisfy the inequalities 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq i \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N and 1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\leq j \\leq 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4104 OR The WWW and PPP in the second type of query don't satisfy the inequality 1\xe2\x89\xa4Wi\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq W_{i} \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4Wi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4100 and 1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\leq P_{i} \\leq 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4106, for all i\xe2\x88\x88[1,N]i \\in [1, N]i\xe2\x88\x88[1,N] then your program will get the verdict Wrong Answer.\nAlso note that there is a hidden WWW and PPP array and the solution is going to be matched exactly against it, i.e there is a unique solution for each test case.\nConstraints\n\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41022 \\leq N \\leq 10^22\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4102\nFor each query of first type: 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq i \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N and 1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\leq j \\leq 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4104\nFor the query of second type: 1\xe2\x89\xa4Wi\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq W_{i} \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4Wi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4100 and 1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\leq P_{i} \\leq 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4106, for all i\xe2\x88\x88[1,N]i \\in [1, N]i\xe2\x88\x88[1,N]\n\nExample\nJudge                                          You\r\n2\r\n                                                    1 1 2\r\n0\r\n                                                    1 1 3\r\n2\r\n                                                    1 2 9\r\n3\r\n                                                    1 2 10\r\n5\r\n                                                    2\r\n                                                    3 7\r\n                                                    2 3\n\nExplanation\nWe get that W=[3,7]W = [3, 7]W=[3,7] and P=[2,3]P = [2, 3]P=[2,3]."
