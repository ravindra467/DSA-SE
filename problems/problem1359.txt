b"Problem\nYou are given N lines (which extend indefinitely in both directions) on the X-Y plane. Some of these lines intersect with each other and others don't (parallel lines). We call each such intersection, an intersection point. You have to find the Kth intersection from the bottom.\n\n\nIn particular, you have to output the smallest value V, such that there are at least K intersection points whose Y-coordinate is \xe2\x89\xa4 V.\n\n\nIf m lines intersect at a particular point, that point is counted m(m-1)/2 times. That is, if only two lines intersect at a point, it is counted as one intersection point. But if three lines intersect at the same point, it is counted as 3 intersection points: one for each pair.\n\n\nYou are guaranteed that all the N lines are distinct, and that there are at least K intersection points between the lines.\n\nInput Format:\n\nThe first line contains the two integers N and K.\n\n\nThe next N lines contain two space separated integers each. The (i+1)th line contains Mi and Ci, such that the equation y = Mi*x + Ci, denotes the ith line.\n\nOutput Format:\n\nOutput one value denoting V as defined in the problem, which should be within 10-2 of the correct answer.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\nK  \xe2\x89\xa5 1\nIt is guaranteed that there are at least K intersection points.

Therefore, we want the y-coordinate of the highest intersection point. We see that the highest intersection point is (-1.5,3.5), and hence the answer is 3.5.\n\nInput 2:\n4 3\n-10 -6\n-5 -10\n2 1\n4 -8\n\nOutput 2:\n-7.429\n"
