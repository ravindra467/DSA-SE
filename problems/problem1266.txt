b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef's friend Igzi is often at the coding gym, working out his mind muscles. When he is there, he asks Chef to guard his most prized posession: a sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b. Initially, for each iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le i \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), Ai=iA_i = iAi\xe2\x80\x8b=i held. However, Chef sometimes gets bored and starts playing with the sequence. Since NNN can be very large, Chef has a lot of fun with it and he would like to share it with you.\nYou should process QQQ queries of two types:\n\n1 x: set Ax=0A_x = 0Ax\xe2\x80\x8b=0\n2 l r: find the maximum element in the subsequence Al,Al+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,ArA_l, A_{l+1}, \\ldots, A_rAl\xe2\x80\x8b,Al+1\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ar\xe2\x80\x8b\n\nSince Chef does not want to make Igzi angry, the queries are encoded so that they have to be processed online:\n\nFor each query, let's denote the sum of answers to all previous queries of type 2, modulo NNN, by sss. (Initially, s=0s = 0s=0.)\nFor each query of the first type, you are given an integer yyy. You can compute xxx as y+sy + sy+s.\nFor each query of the second type, you are given two integers ppp and qqq. You can compute lll as p+sp + sp+s and rrr as q+sq + sq+s.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and QQQ.\nThe following QQQ lines describe queries.\n\nEach of these lines starts with an integer ttt denoting the type of the current query: t=1t = 1t=1 for a query of the first type or t=2t = 2t=2 for a query of the second type.\nFor a query of the first type, it is followed by a space and an integer yyy.\nFor a query of the second type, it is followed by a space and two space-separated integers ppp and qqq.\n\n\n\nOutput\nFor each query of the second type, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the maximum of the given subsequence.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\le T \\le 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410181 \\le N \\le 10^{18}1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41018\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4500,0001 \\le Q \\le 500,0001\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4500,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le l \\le r \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le x \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4N\nthe sum of QQQ over all test cases does not exceed 1,000,0001,000,0001,000,000\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): N,Q\xe2\x89\xa41,000N, Q \\le 1,000N,Q\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nSubtask #2 (10 points): N\xe2\x89\xa4100,000N \\le 100,000N\xe2\x89\xa4100,000\nSubtask #3 (30 points): each query of the second type appears after all queries of the first type\nSubtask #4 (50 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n7 9\n2 2 5\n1 0\n2 -3 0\n1 1\n2 0 3\n1 -4\n1 -2\n2 -4 -1\n2 -5 -35  \n4\n4\n0\n1\nExplanation:\n\nQuery 1: l=2l = 2l=2, r=5r = 5r=5.

After this query, sss becomes 5%7=55\\%7 = 55%7=5.\nQuery 2: x=5x = 5x=5. A5A_5A5\xe2\x80\x8b becomes 000.\nQuery 3: l=2l = 2l=2, r=5r = 5r=5.
