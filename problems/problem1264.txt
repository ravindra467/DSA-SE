b'Problem\n"Stick with the strongest team, that\'s the only way."\nGi-Hun and his mates have survived the deadly night, but now it\xe2\x80\x99s time for the tug of war. The game proceeds as follows:\nTwo teams have to face off against each other in a tug of war match. The match proceeds in a series of rounds as follows:\n\nInitially, one player from each team will come forward to play.\nThe one who wins the round will stay in, while the loser is eliminated. If the round is a draw, both players are eliminated.\nWhen a member of a team is eliminated, that team then sends another person to play in the next round.\nThis process continues as long as both teams have at least one player left.\n\nNote that if a player wins their round, they must stay in for the next round \xe2\x80\x94 they cannot be replaced by another player.\nA team is said to win the match if it has at least 111 player remaining, while all players of the opponent\'s team are eliminated. If both teams have no players left, the match is said to be a draw.\nGi-Hun has to come up with a strategy for his team to win the game. He saw the opponent queue of NNN players, where their ithi^{\\text{th}}ith player has strength AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b. He also knows that the opponent will send the players in the same order as they appear in AAA.

The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and MMM \xe2\x80\x94 the sizes of the opponent team and Gi-Hun\'s team, respectively.\nThe second line of each test case contains NNN space-separated integers, A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x94 the strengths of the opponents, in order.\nThe third line of each test case contains MMM space-separated integers, B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BMB_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_MB1\xe2\x80\x8b,B2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,BM\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x94 the strengths of Gi-Hun\'s team.\n\nOutput Format\n\nThe first line of each test case should contain a single string, either \xe2\x80\x9cYES\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cNO\xe2\x80\x9d, denoting whether it is possible for Gi-Hun\'s team to win or not.\nIf the first line contains "YES", print a second line containing MMM space-separated integers \xe2\x80\x94 the lexicographically smallest ordering which will allow Gi-Hun\'s team to win.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\leq T \\leq 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\leq N,M \\leq 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,Bj\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq A_i,B_j \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b,Bj\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109 (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq i \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N, 1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4M1 \\leq j \\leq M1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4M)\nSum of NNN and MMM across all test cases will not exceed 10610^6106\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput5\n3 1\n4 3 5\n6\n3 3\n2 4 7\n2 3 7\n3 3\n2 7 4\n2 7 3\n4 4\n2 6 5 1\n4 6 5 2\n2 2\n7 4\n7 4\nYES\n6\nYES\n2 7 3\nNO\nYES\n2 6 5 4\nNO\n\nExplanation:\nTest Case 1: There is only one possible ordering, that being [6][6][6]. The match will proceed as follows:\n\nRound 1: B1=6B_1 = 6B1\xe2\x80\x8b=6 will defeat A1=4A_1 = 4A1\xe2\x80\x8b=4, A1A_1A1\xe2\x80\x8b is eliminated.\nRound 2: B1=6B_1 = 6B1\xe2\x80\x8b=6 will defeat A2=3A_2 = 3A2\xe2\x80\x8b=3, A2A_2A2\xe2\x80\x8b is eliminated.\nRound 3: B1=6B_1 = 6B1\xe2\x80\x8b=6 will defeat A3=5A_3 = 5A3\xe2\x80\x8b=5, A3A_3A3\xe2\x80\x8b is eliminated.\n\nB1B_1B1\xe2\x80\x8b still remains and all opponents have been defeated, making this a victory for Gi-Hun\'s team.\nTest Case 2: The ordering which result in victory are [2,7,3],[3,7,2],[7,2,3][2,7,3],[3,7,2],[7,2,3][2,7,3],[3,7,2],[7,2,3], and [7,3,2][7,3,2][7,3,2]. Of these, the lexicographically smallest is [2,7,3][2, 7, 3][2,7,3].\nLet Q=[2,7,3]Q = [2, 7, 3]Q=[2,7,3]. The match proceeds as follows:\n\nRound 1: Q1=2Q_1 = 2Q1\xe2\x80\x8b=2 will draw with A1=2A_1 = 2A1\xe2\x80\x8b=2, eliminating both.\nRound 2: Q2=7Q_2 = 7Q2\xe2\x80\x8b=7 will defeat A2=4A_2 = 4A2\xe2\x80\x8b=4, eliminating A2A_2A2\xe2\x80\x8b.\nRound 3: Q2=7Q_2 = 7Q2\xe2\x80\x8b=7 will draw with A3=7A_3 = 7A3\xe2\x80\x8b=7, eliminating both.\n\nQ3=3Q_3 = 3Q3\xe2\x80\x8b=3 still remains, so Gi-Hun\'s team wins.\nTest Case 3: It is not possible to win the match.'
