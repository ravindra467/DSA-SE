b'Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given N points on 2-D plane. You have to find out minimal radius of a circle which contains at least M of these points. \nInput\nFirst line of the input contains two space separated integer N and M.\nEach of the next N lines contains two space separated real numbers denoting the x and y coordinates of i-th point, i.e. xi, yi. These numbers with not contain more than 5 digits after decimal point.\nOutput\nOutput a single floating point number corresponding to the minimal radius of a circle with at least M of the above points. Your answer will be considered correct iff its absolute error does not exceed more than 10-2.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 500\n-103 \xe2\x89\xa4 Xi, Yi \xe2\x89\xa4 103\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 (35 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 200\nSubtask #2 (65 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 500\n\nExample\n Input:\n3 3\n-1 -1\n0 1\n1 -1\nOutput:\n1.250000'
