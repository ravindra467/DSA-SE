b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nFor a string S, let\'s define a function F(S) as the minimum number of blocks consisting of consecutive identical characters in S. In other words, F(S) is equal to 1 plus the number of valid indices i such that Si \xe2\x89\xa0 Si+1.\nYou are given two strings A and B with lengths N and M respectively. You should merge these two strings into one string C with length N+M. Specifically, each character of C should come either from A or B; all characters from A should be in the same relative order in C as in A and all characters from B should be in the same relative order in C as in B.\nCompute the minimum possible value of F(C).\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M.\nThe second line contains a single string A with length N.\nThe third line contains a single string B with length M.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum possible value of F(C).\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, M \xe2\x89\xa4 5,000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 sum of N in all test cases \xe2\x89\xa4 5,000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 sum of M in all test cases \xe2\x89\xa4 5,000\nstrings A, B consist only of lowercase English letters\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (10 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T, N, M \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n\n\nSubtask 2 (20 points): the characters of A and B are sorted in non-decreasing order\n\n\nSubtask 3 (70 points): original constraints\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n4 4\nabab\nbaba5\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: One possible way to choose the string C to get the desired answer is "abbaabba".'
