b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Mandarin Chinese.\nChef organised a chess tournament, which spanned over MMM months. There were NNN players, and player iii was rated RiR_iRi\xe2\x80\x8b before the start of the tournament. To see the progress of the players, he noted their rating changes at the end of each month.\nAfter the tournament, FIDE asked Chef to find the number of players whose peak rating and peak ranking did not occur in the same month. In other words, Chef was asked to find the ratings and ranking of each player after each of the MMM months. Then, using this data, he should find the number of players, such that the month in which they achieved their highest rating over all the months, was different from the month in which they achieved their best rank (based on ratings), over all the months. Note that we do not consider the initial rating/ranking, but only the rating and rankings after each of the MMM months.\nFor a particular player, if there are multiple peak rating or peak ranking months, Chef was to consider the earliest of them. If multiple players had the same rating at the end of some month, they were to be given the same rank. For example, if there were 555 players, and their ratings at the end of some month were (2600(2600(2600, 259025902590, 260026002600, 260026002600 and 2590)2590)2590), players 111, 333 and 444 were to be given the first rank, while players 222 and 555 should be given the fourth rank.\nAs Chef hates statistics, he asks you, his friend, to help him find this. Can you help Chef?\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains an integer TTT, the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and MMM, the number of players and the number of months that the tournament spanned over.\nThe second line of each test case contains NNN space-separated integers, R1,R2,\xe2\x80\xa6,RNR_1, R_2, \\ldots, R_NR1\xe2\x80\x8b,R2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,RN\xe2\x80\x8b denoting the initial ratings of the players, i.e., their ratings before the start of the tournament.\nThe next NNN lines each contain MMM space-separated integers. The jthj^{th}jth integer of the ithi^{th}ith line, Ci,jC_{i,j}Ci,j\xe2\x80\x8b denotes the rating change of the ithi^{th}ith player after the jthj^{th}jth month.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, print the number of players whose peak ratings did not occur in the same month as their peak ranking, in a new line.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\le T \\le 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa45001 \\le N,M \\le 5001\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4500\n1800\xe2\x89\xa4Ri\xe2\x89\xa428001800 \\le R_i \\le 28001800\xe2\x89\xa4Ri\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa42800\n\xe2\x88\x9220\xe2\x89\xa4Ci,j\xe2\x89\xa420-20 \\le C_{i,j} \\le 20\xe2\x88\x9220\xe2\x89\xa4Ci,j\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa420\n\nSubtasks\n\n30 points : 1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4501 \\leq N,M \\leq 501\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa450\n70 points : Original constraints.\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n3 3\n2500 2500 2520\n10 -5 -20\n10 15 20\n-15 17 13\n2 3\n2125 2098\n-20 10 -10\n10 10 -202\n2\nExplanation:\nTest case 1:\n\n\nThe ratings for player 111 after each month are: (2510(2510(2510, 250525052505 and 2485)2485)2485), while his rankings are first, third and third, respectively. Thus, his best rating and best ranking occur after the same month, i.e., after the first month.\n\n\nThe ratings for player 222 after each month are: (2510(2510(2510, 252525252525 and 2545)2545)2545), while his rankings are first, first and first, respectively. His best rating occurs after the third month, while his best ranking occurs after the first month (we consider the first month even though his peak ranking is over all the months, because we consider only the earliest month where he attains the peak ranking).\n\n\nThe ratings for player 333 after each month are: (2505(2505(2505, 252225222522 and 2535)2535)2535), while his rankings are third, second and second, respectively. His best rating occurs after the third month, while his best ranking occurs after the second month.\n\n\nSo there are two players (222 and 333), whose peak ratings did not occur in the same month as their peak ranking, and hence the answer is 2.\nTest case 2:\n\n\nThe ratings for player 111 after each month are: (2105(2105(2105, 211521152115 and 2105)2105)2105), while his rankings are second, second and first, respectively. Best rating is after second month, but best ranking is after third month.\n\n\nThe ratings for player 222 after each month are: (2108(2108(2108, 211821182118 and 2098)2098)2098), while his rankings are first, first and second, respectively. Best rating is after second month, but best ranking is after first month.\n\n\nSo there are two players (111 and 222), whose peak ratings did not occur in the same month as their peak ranking, and hence the answer is 2.'
