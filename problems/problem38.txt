b'Problem\nChef is playing a game on a sequence of NNN positive integers, say A1,A2,...ANA_1, A_2, ... A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,...AN\xe2\x80\x8b The game is played as follows.\n\nIf all the numbers are equal, the game ends.\nOtherwise\n\nSelect two numbers which are unequal\nSubtract the smaller number from the larger number\nReplace the larger number with the result from above\n\n\n\nChef has already figured out that the game always terminates. He also knows, for a given sequence of integers, the game will always terminate on the same value, no matter how the game is played. Chef wants you to simulate the game for him and tell him if the game terminates on 111.\nIn fact, there may be many such games. Given a sequence of integers Chef wants to know the number of sub-sequences of the given sequence, for which, playing the above game on the subsuquence will terminate on 111. A sub-sequence can be obtained from the original sequence by deleting 000 or more integers from the original sequence. See the explanation section for clarity.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer TTT, the number of test cases. Then follow the description of TTT test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN, the length of the sequence.\nThe second line contains NNN positive integers, each separated by a single space.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single integer - the number of sub-sequences of the original sequence, such that, playing the game on the sub-sequence results in ending the game with all the values equal to 111.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le T \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4601 \\le N \\le 601\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa460\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\le A_i \\le 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4104\nAll AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b will be distinct.\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n4\n2 3 5 7\n4\n3 4 8 16\n3\n6 10 1511\n7\n1\nExplanation:\nTest Case 1: The following 111111 sub-sequences are counted.\n\n{2,3}\\{ 2, 3 \\}{2,3}\n{2,5}\\{ 2, 5 \\}{2,5}\n{2,7}\\{ 2, 7 \\}{2,7}\n{3,5}\\{ 3, 5 \\}{3,5}\n{3,7}\\{ 3, 7 \\}{3,7}\n{5,7}\\{ 5, 7 \\}{5,7}\n{2,3,5}\\{ 2, 3, 5 \\}{2,3,5}\n{2,3,7}\\{ 2, 3, 7 \\}{2,3,7}\n{2,5,7}\\{ 2, 5, 7 \\}{2,5,7}\n{3,5,7}\\{ 3, 5, 7 \\}{3,5,7}\n{2,3,5,7}\\{ 2, 3, 5, 7 \\}{2,3,5,7}\n\nTest Case 2: The following 777 sub-sequences are counted.\n\n{3,4}\\{ 3, 4 \\}{3,4}\n{3,8}\\{ 3, 8 \\}{3,8}\n{3,16}\\{ 3, 16 \\}{3,16}\n{3,4,8}\\{ 3, 4, 8 \\}{3,4,8}\n{3,4,16}\\{ 3, 4, 16 \\}{3,4,16}\n{3,8,16}\\{ 3, 8, 16 \\}{3,8,16}\n{3,4,8,16}\\{ 3, 4, 8, 16 \\}{3,4,8,16}\n\nTest Case 3: There are 888 subsequences of {6,10,15}\\{ 6, 10, 15 \\}{6,10,15}\n\n{}\\{\\}{} => The game cannot be played on this sub-sequence\n{6}\\{ 6 \\}{6} => The game cannot be played on this sub-sequence\n{10}\\{ 10 \\}{10} => The game cannot be played on this sub-sequence\n{15}\\{ 15 \\}{15} => The game cannot be played on this sub-sequence\n{6,10}\\{ 6, 10 \\}{6,10} =\\gt The game cannot end at {1,1}\\{ 1, 1 \\}{1,1}\n{6,15}\\{ 6, 15 \\}{6,15} =\\gt The game cannot end at {1,1}\\{ 1, 1 \\}{1,1}\n{10,15}\\{ 10, 15 \\}{10,15} =\\gt The game cannot end at {1,1}\\{ 1, 1 \\}{1,1}\n{6,10,15}\\{ 6, 10, 15 \\}{6,10,15} =\\gt The game ends at {1,1,1}\\{ 1, 1, 1 \\}{1,1,1}.
