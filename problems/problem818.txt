b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a string SSS with length NNN and you should change it to a palindrome using a sequence of zero or more operations. In one operation, you should choose two adjacent elements of SSS (two characters) and swap them; however, neither of these elements may be used in any other operation.\nFind the minimum number of operations you have to perform in order to change the string SSS into a palindrome, or determine that it is impossible.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nThe second line contains a single string SSS with length NNN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case:\n\nIf it is impossible to make the string SSS a palindrome, print a single line containing the string "NO" (without quotes).\nOtherwise, print two lines. The first of these lines should contain the string "YES" (without quotes). The second line should contain a single integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum required number of operations.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410,0001 \\le T \\le 10,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le N \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nSSS contains only lowercase English letters\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 10610^6106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points):\n\nN\xe2\x89\xa4103N \\le 10^3N\xe2\x89\xa4103\nSSS contains only characters \'a\' and \'b\'\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 10410^4104\n\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n4\nabab\n5\nacbba\n5\naaaabYES\n1\nYES\n1\nNO'
