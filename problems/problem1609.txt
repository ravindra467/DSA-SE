b'Problem\nThe title of the problem has nothing to do with the problem. You are given an integer N and an array C of positive integers of size N.Is there a weighted graph with positive integer weights on N vertices such that sum of weights of edges adjacent to vertex i is C[i] and weight of edge between i and j is at most i bitwise-xor j\nInput\n First line contains T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of 2 lines. First Line contains N, the number of nodes in the graph.\nNext line contains N integers, denoting array C\n\nOutput\noutput on a single line "Yes" if such a graph exists,"No" otherwise. \nConstraints\n\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 5\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 C[i] \xe2\x89\xa4 10^5\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput1:\n1\n2\n2 2\nInput2:\n1\n3\n2 3 2\nOutput1:\nYes\nOutput2:\nNo\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nExample case 1. We have a single edge of weight 2 between 1 and 2\nExample case 2. No graph is possible'
