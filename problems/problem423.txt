b'Problem\n\nGiven a n*n grid with every cell in it consisting of number 1,2 or 3. A person standing at cell (a,b) can go to (c,d) only if (c-a)+(d-b)=1 and c>=a and d>=b.\nThe cost of a walk is the product of all the numbers on the cells visited in that walk.\nNow you have to answer q queries of the form: for each given x, y ->\nYou start at (1,1) and end your walk in the cell (n,n), now you want to know if there is a walk such that its cost is equal to 2x*3y.\n\nInput\n\nFirst line will contain n the dimension of the grid.\nNext n ines contain n values each denoting the values in the jth cell of the ith row.\nNext line contains an integer q no of queries.\nNext q lines contains 2 integers x and y denoting the query.\n\nOutput\nFor every query print "YES"(without quotes) if there is a walk with cost 2x*3y and "NO" otherwise.\nConstraints\n\n1 <= n <= 18\n1 <= Ai,j <= 3\n1 <= q <= 1000\n1 <= x,y <= 2*n-1\n\nExample\nInput:\n5\n1 2 2 3 1\n1 1 1 2 3\n1 2 3 1 2\n1 2 2 2 2\n3 3 3 3 3\n1\n6 1\nOutput:\nYES\n'
