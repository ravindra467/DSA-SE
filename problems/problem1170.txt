b"Problem\nToday is a very special day for Phoenix as there is a large fair in his city and so he goes in. He finds a game quite amusing and enters it, only to find that he isn\xe2\x80\x99t able to exit it without completing the game.\nThe game has the following rules :\r\nThere are NNN number of stones and each stone has 262626 different possibilities of being painted with any letter from aaa to zzz. Now, Phoenix can start from any stone and can jump to any stone but he has to take the maximum number of stones that he can traverse given that they all contain the same character each and the distance between the first and the last stone is minimum. Phoenix can only exit the room if he can foretell the exact distance between the first and the last character that occurs the maximum number of times. If all the parameters are equal for some set of characters, then print lexicographically minimum character.\nAnd of course, as every coding problem ends, he needs your help. So, help him dear coder.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nEach test case contains of two line of input.\nFirst line will contain a single integer NNN denoting the length of string.\nSecond line will contain the given string.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, print a character which occurs the maximum number of times and a integer, the minimum length of substring that contains all occurrence of that character.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq T \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq |S| \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4105\nThe overall sum of string lengths will not exceed 10610^6106\n\nSample Input:\n    3\r\n    3\r\n    abc\r\n    6\r\n    aabcbb\r\n    6\r\n    xbxybz\n\nSample Output:\n    a 1\r\n    b 4\r\n    x 3\n\nEXPLANATION:\nIn the first test case, frequency of all the characters is same and size of each substring is also same(i.e. 1). Hence the answer will be aaa, which is the lexicographically minimum.\nIn the third test case, frequency of xxx and bbb is maximum. But size of substring containing all the occurrence of xxx is smaller than that of bbb. Hence the answer is xxx and it's corresponding substring size."
