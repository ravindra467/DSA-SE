b"Problem\nChef is playing an easier variation of the board game \xe2\x80\x98Risk\xe2\x80\x99 with his friend Mike. There is an N\xe2\x88\x97MN * MN\xe2\x88\x97M grid, depicting the world map. Each cell of the grid is either 111 or 000 where 111 denotes that there is land on this cell, while 000 denotes water.\nIn a turn, a player can capture an uncaptured cell that has land, and keep capturing neighbouring cells that share a side with it if they are on land. A cell once captured by a player can't be captured again by another player. The game continues till no uncaptured cell has land. Each player wants to be in control of as many cells of land as possible in total when the game finishes. Find the maximum number of cells of land that Chef can capture if he plays second, and both players play optimally.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nEach testcase contains N+1N + 1N+1 lines of input.\nFirst line will contain 222 space separated integers NNN and MMM denoting the size of the grid.\nEach of the next NNN lines contains a binary string of length MMM depicting the map.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line answer to the problem.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N, M \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4105\nEach character in the grid is either 000 or 111\nThere's atleast 111 land on the grid\nSum of N\xe2\x88\x97MN * MN\xe2\x88\x97M over all testcases is almost 10610^6106.\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n4 4\n1001\n0110\n0110\n1001\n2 2\n11\n11\n3 3\n100\n010\n0012\n0\n1\nExplanation:\nIn test case 1, if both players play optimally, it takes 555 steps to finish the game:\nStep 1: First Mike chooses the cells {(2,2),(2,3),(3,2),(3,3)}\\{(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)\\}{(2,2),(2,3),(3,2),(3,3)} adding 444 to his score.\nStep 2: Second Chef chooses the cell {(1,1)}\\{(1, 1)\\}{(1,1)} adding 111 to his score.\nStep 3: Next Mike chooses the cell {(1,4)}\\{(1, 4)\\}{(1,4)} adding 111 to his score.\nStep 4: Next Chef chooses the cell {(4,1)}\\{(4, 1)\\}{(4,1)} adding 111 to his score.\nStep 5: Finally, Mike chooses the cell {(4,4)}\\{(4, 4)\\}{(4,4)} adding 111 to his score.\nHence total score of Chef is 1+1=21 + 1 = 21+1=2."
