b'Problem\nBob and Alice are very close friends. Once they decided to go to a shop to buy strings for themselves. The strings available in the shop contain only lowercase Latin letters. Alice and Bob decided to buy strings of the same length NNN. They also wanted the strings to be equal.\nIt is guaranteed that the shop has at least two strings of the length NNN. But it\'s not guaranteed that the shop has two equal strings. Hence, they decided to exchange characters among themselves to make the strings equal. Let the two strings they bought be represented by AAA and BBB. For all iii such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N21\\leq i\\leq \\frac{N}{2}1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa42N\xe2\x80\x8b, they can perform the following operations on the strings any number of times:\n\nSwap AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b with BiB_iBi\xe2\x80\x8b\nSwap AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b with AN\xe2\x88\x92i+1A_{N-i+1}AN\xe2\x88\x92i+1\xe2\x80\x8b\n\nYou have to tell the minimum number of operations needed to make the strings equal. Or determine that it\'s impossible.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, the number of test cases. Then TTT the test cases follow.\nFirst line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nSecond line of each test case contains a single string AAA.\nThrid line of each test case contains a single string BBB.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, output in a single line the required answer. If it not possible to make the strings equal, print "-1".\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq T \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\xe2\x88\xa3A\xe2\x88\xa3=\xe2\x88\xa3B\xe2\x88\xa3=N|A|=|B|=N\xe2\x88\xa3A\xe2\x88\xa3=\xe2\x88\xa3B\xe2\x88\xa3=N\nStrings contain only lowercase Latin letters\n\nSample Input:\n2\n4\nwbbw\nrbbr\n1\nr\nz\nSample Output:\n2\n-1'
