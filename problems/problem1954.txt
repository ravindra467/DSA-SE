b'Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\n\nChef, to entertain customers, decided to establish some kind of game in his restaurant. And here is what he invented:\nn players sit around a round table. There is n * m cards with unique numbers of range 1..n*m.\nEach player has m cards. In each set of the game each player selects some card and everyone shows his card at the same time. Card of ith player is compared to card of player p[i]. If it\xe2\x80\x99s number is greater than the number on card of player p[i], then ith gets a point. P is a permutation of sequence 0..n-1.\nBut all customers when playing this game want to win. Chef on his side wants to please his customers. So, he decided to give cards in such way, that each player gets a point with probability larger than \xc2\xbd.\nBut it appears to be a complicated task, so he asks you for help.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\nFirst line of input contains T \xe2\x80\x93 number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of two lines. First line contains two numbers \xe2\x80\x93 n and m. Second one \xe2\x80\x93 permutation p.\nOutput\nFor each test case, if there\xe2\x80\x99s no solution output single line \xe2\x80\x9cNo Solution\xe2\x80\x9d (without quotes), otherwise output n lines with cards for each player. ith line should contain m numbers in increasing order \xe2\x80\x93 numbers on ith player\xe2\x80\x99s cards.\nExtra spaces at the end of the line are not allowed.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n, m \xe2\x89\xa4 103\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n2\n1 1\n0\n3 3\n2 0 1\nOutput:\nNo Solution\n2 6 7\n3 4 8\n1 5 9\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nFor second test case, probability is 5/9 for each player to get a point.\n\xc2\xa0'
