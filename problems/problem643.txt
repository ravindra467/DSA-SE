b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nIn Chefland, there are NNN cities (numbered 111 through NNN). Initially, there are no roads between them. The Mayor of Chefland has ordered engineers to build roads across Chefland in such a way that each city is reachable from all other cities.\nFor each pair of distinct cities iii and jjj, the cost of building a road between these cities is equal to (i\xe2\x88\xa7ji \\wedge ji\xe2\x88\xa7j), where \xe2\x88\xa7\\wedge\xe2\x88\xa7 denotes the bitwise AND operation. However, leaders of the cities have a weird condition \xe2\x80\x95 they only allow roads with positive costs to be built from their cities.\nHelp the Mayor find the minimum cost of building roads in the required way or determine that it is impossible.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum cost of building the roads or \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051 \\le T \\le 2 \\cdot 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41092 \\le N \\le 10^92\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n3\n53\n8\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: We can connect city 111 with city 333 by a road with cost 111 and city 333 with city 222 by a road with cost 222.'
