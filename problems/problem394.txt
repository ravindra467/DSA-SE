b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nFor two strings AAA and BBB with the same length NNN, we will say that they are equivalent if the following rule holds: For each pair of integers lll and rrr (1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le l \\le r \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4N), the substring of AAA between the lll-th and rrr-th character (inclusive) is a palindrome if and only if the substring of BBB between the lll-th and rrr-th character (inclusive) is a palindrome.\nYou are given a string SSS with length NNN. Find the number of sets P\xe2\x8a\x82{1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,N}P \\subset \\{1, 2, \\ldots, N\\}P\xe2\x8a\x82{1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,N} such that there is a character ccc and a string XXX which is equivalent to SSS and satisfies Xp=cX_p = cXp\xe2\x80\x8b=c for each p\xe2\x88\x88Pp \\in Pp\xe2\x88\x88P. Since the answer may be large, compute it modulo 998,244,353998,244,353998,244,353.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single string SSS with length NNN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the number of subsets of characters that can be equal to each other in some string equivalent to SSS, modulo 998,244,353998,244,353998,244,353.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le T \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42,0001 \\le N \\le 2,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42,000\nSSS contains only lowercase Latin letters\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): N\xe2\x89\xa410N \\le 10N\xe2\x89\xa410\nSubtask #2 (90 points): T\xe2\x89\xa410T \\le 10T\xe2\x89\xa410\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\naaa\naba8\n5'
