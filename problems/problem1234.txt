b"Problem\nYou may have helped Chef and prevented Doof from destroying the even numbers. But, it has only angered Dr Doof even further. However, for his next plan, he needs some time. Therefore, Doof has built NNN walls to prevent Chef from interrupting him. You have to help Chef by telling him the number of walls he needs to destroy in order to reach Dr Doof.\nFormally, the whole area can be represented as the first quadrant with the origin at the bottom-left corner. Dr. Doof is located at the origin (0,0)(0, 0)(0,0). There are NNN walls, the i-th wall is a straight line segment joining the points (ai,0)(a_i, 0)(ai\xe2\x80\x8b,0) and (0,ai)(0, a_i)(0,ai\xe2\x80\x8b). For every initial position of Chef (xj,yj)(x_j, y_j)(xj\xe2\x80\x8b,yj\xe2\x80\x8b), find the number of walls he needs to break before reaching Doof. Obviously, chef can't start from a point on the wall. Therefore, if (xj,yj)(x_j, y_j)(xj\xe2\x80\x8b,yj\xe2\x80\x8b) lies on any of the given walls, print \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 in a new line.\nInput\n\nFirst line contains TTT, denoting the number of testcases.\nThe first line of every test case contains a single integer NNN denoting the number of walls Dr Doof has built.\nThe next line contains NNN space separated distinct integers each denoting aia_iai\xe2\x80\x8b.\nThe next line contains a single integer QQQ denoting the number of times Chef asks for your help.\nThe next QQQ lines contains two space separated integers xjx_jxj\xe2\x80\x8b and yjy_jyj\xe2\x80\x8b, each denoting the co-ordinates of the starting point of Chef.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, print the number of walls Chef needs to break in order to reach Dr Doof in a separate line. If Chef tries to start from a point on any of the walls, print \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x971021 \\leq T \\leq 2 * 10^21\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x97102\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x971051 \\leq N, Q \\leq 2 * 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x97105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\n0\xe2\x89\xa4xj,yj\xe2\x89\xa41090 \\leq x_j, y_j \\leq 10^90\xe2\x89\xa4xj\xe2\x80\x8b,yj\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\na_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; a_3 &lt; .... \\lt a_N\nSum of NNN and QQQ over all testcases for a particular test file does not exceed 2\xe2\x88\x971052 * 10^52\xe2\x88\x97105\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n2\n1 3\n5\n0 0\n2 0\n0 4\n1 1\n1 20\n1\n2\n1\n-1\nExplanation:\nThe sample input can be represented by the graph given below:\n\nIf Chef starts from (0,0)(0, 0)(0,0), he can reach Dr Doof without destroying any wall.\nIf Chef starts from (2,0)(2, 0)(2,0), he has to destroy the 1st1st1st wall.\nIf Chef starts from (0,4)(0, 4)(0,4), he has to destroy both the walls.\nIf Chef starts from (1,1)(1, 1)(1,1), he has to destroy the 1st1st1st wall.\nAs (1,2)(1, 2)(1,2) lies on the second wall, the answer is \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 for the last query."
