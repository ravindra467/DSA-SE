b'Problem\nYou are given a family tree with NNN members numbered 1...N1 ... N1...N. Every person iii, except for the founder of the family (root) has a parent denoted by P[i]P[i]P[i]. P[root]P[root]P[root] = -1 by definition. Person iii is a descendant of person jjj if iii belongs to the subtree rooted at jjj.\nThe net worth (adjusted for inflation) is given for all the members of the family. Your task is to find the maximum difference in net worth\'s of two members where one member is a descendant of the other.\nYou can assume that no two members of this family married each other. So it remains a "family tree".\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain  an integer NNN, denoting the number of members.\nSecond line contains N space seperated integers W[1], W[2] ... W[N] denoting the net_worth of the N members.\nThird line contains  N space seperated integers P[1], P[2] ... P[N] denoting the parents of the N members.\n\nOutput:\nOutput in a single line the maximum difference in net worth\'s of any two members where one member is a descendant of the other.\nConstraints\n\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41052 \\leq N \\leq 10^52\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\xe2\x88\x92108\xe2\x89\xa4W[i]\xe2\x89\xa4108-10^8 \\leq W[i] \\leq 10^8\xe2\x88\x92108\xe2\x89\xa4W[i]\xe2\x89\xa4108\n1\xe2\x89\xa4P[i]\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq P[i] \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4P[i]\xe2\x89\xa4N\n\nSample Input:\n4 \r\n5 10 6 12 \r\n2 -1 4 2 \n\nSample Output:\n6\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThis structure of the tree is:\n        2            \r\n       / \\            \r\n      1   4\r\n         /\r\n        3\n\nThe maximum difference occurs between the 3rd and 4th members.
