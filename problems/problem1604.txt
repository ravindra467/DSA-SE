b'Problem\n\n  Mr. Yagami is playing a game of arrays. He is given two random arrays A and B\n  consisting of N positive integer elements. Game starts by Mr. Yagami assigning 0 or 1\n  to each element in A and B.\nAfter this assignment is done, a graph is constructed with a node for each\n  element in the array A and B (2N nodes) and no edges. The game proceeds with a\n  valid move being defined in the following way:\n\n  One of the arrays from A or B is selected.\n  From the selected array, an element which has been marked 0 is chosen. Let us\n  call this element as X.\n A set of elements, Y, are chosen from the array, which was not chosen in the\n  first step, such that all elements of Y should be marked as 1 and all elements\n  of Y should be greater than X and no element of Y should be coprime to X.\nFinally an edge is drawn from the node labelled X to all the nodes\n  corresponding to the elements in set Y. There can only be a single edge\n  between any 2 nodes in the graph.\n\n  He can make as many valid moves. Mr. Yagami receives 1 point for each edge\n  that is drawn in the graph.\n  Mr. Yagami is very clever, so he makes the initial assignment in such a way\n  that it maximizes the number of points he receives in the game. You have to\n  return the maximum number of points that Mr. Yagami can receive.\n  \nInput Format:\n\n  The first line of the input contains a single integer, N (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4\n  40)\n  The second line of input contains N integers separated by a single space\n  character, which represent the elements of the array A. (2 \xe2\x89\xa4 A[i] \xe2\x89\xa4  10^9)\n  Similarly, the last line of input also contains N integers separated by a\n  single space character, which represent the elements of the array B. (2 \xe2\x89\xa4 \n  B[i] \xe2\x89\xa4 10^9)\n\nOutput Format:\n\n  A single integer representing the maximum score which Mr. Yagami can receive.\n  \nSample Input:\n4\n16 3 2 9\n12 18 13 4\n<h3>Sample Output:</h3>\n<pre>8</pre>\n\nExplanation:\n\n  He picks 2 from first array. So he gets to put 3 edges ie. 2->4, 2->12,\n  2->18.\t\n  Next he picks 3 from the first array. So he gets to put 2 edges ie. 3->12,\n  3->18.\n  Next he picks 9 from the first array. So he gets to put 2 edges ie. 9->12,\n  9->18.\n  Next he picks 16 from the first array. So he gets to put 1 edge ie. 16->18.\n  Total edges=8.\n\n\nProblem Setter: Lalit Kundu'
