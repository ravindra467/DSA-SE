b'Problem\nHey Welcome to competitive coding event of Code_Blasters !\nSo let\'s start with a warm up exercise first.\nchef is a master of two number game ,and chef wants you to play this game with you as he has nothing to do due to COVID-19 lockdown.\nThe game is simple chef will give you two numbers (let\'s say aaa and bbb  ) and you need to tell whether the given two numbers can become equal after performing given operations.\n\nIncrementing aaa by 1 OR\ndecrementing bbb by 1\n\nNOTE: you can perform the given two operations any number of times.\nInput:\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT .TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT   test   cases follows.\nEach test case contains two space seperated integer aaa and bbb denoting the two number given by chef.\n\nOutput:\n\nFor each test case, print "YES"(without quotes) if it is possible to make a and b equal, else print "NO"(without quotes).\n\nConstraints:\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq T \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4a\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\leq a \\leq 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4a\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4b\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\leq b \\leq 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4b\xe2\x89\xa4106\n\nSample Input:\n2\r\n5 7\r\n10000 5000\n\nSample Output:\nYES\r\nNO\n'
