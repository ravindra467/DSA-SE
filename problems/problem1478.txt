b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.\nThis is an interactive problem.\nThere is a hidden undirected graph with nnn vertices. There are no self-loops or multiple edges. Each vertex is colored black or white, and the colors are also hidden from you.\nTo make a query, you choose a vertex vvv. The interactor will respond with the current color of vvv, and then it will flip the colors of all vertices adjacent to vvv. A vertex is not considered adjacent to itself, so the color of vvv doesn\'t change.\nAfter at most 600060006000 queries, find the adjacency matrix of the graph.\nNote: The interactor is not adaptive. In other words, the graph and colors are fixed in the beginning.\nInteraction\nBegin the interaction by reading a single integer nnn - the number of vertices in the graph.\nTo ask a query, output "? v" for a vertex vvv (1\xe2\x89\xa4v\xe2\x89\xa4n1\\le v\\le n1\xe2\x89\xa4v\xe2\x89\xa4n). Then read a single character describing the current color of vvv, where "B" denotes black and "W" denotes white. After making this query, the colors of all vertices adjacent to vvv will flip.\nTo print the answer, output "!" then on the next nnn lines print nnn strings of length nnn, consisting of symbols "0" and "1". The jjj-th character of the iii-th string should be "1" if and only if there is an edge between vertices iii and jjj. Since there are no self-loops, the main diagonal should contain only "0".\nIf at any time you make an invalid query or exceed the query limit, the interaction is terminated and you will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.\nRemember to flush the output after printing each line!\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41001\\le n\\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4100\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\nW\nB\nB\nW\n? 1\n? 2\n? 3\n? 2\n!\n001\n001\n110\nExplanation:\nThe example is given to demonstrate how the queries work, and it is not guaranteed that the answer can be uniquely determined from the queries in the example.\nThe hidden graph is a path 1\xe2\x88\x923\xe2\x88\x9221-3-21\xe2\x88\x923\xe2\x88\x922. Initially, the colors for nodes 111, 222, 333 are white, black, black, respectively. Denote it by the string WBB.\nThe first query asks for node 111. The interactor responds with its color W then flips the color of node 333. The colors are now WBW.\nThe second query asks for node 222. The interactor responds with its color B then flips the color of node 333. The colors are now WBB.\nThe third query asks for node 333. The interactor responds with its color B then flips the colors of nodes 111 and 222. The colors are now BWB.\nThe fourth query asks for node 222. The interactor responds with its color W then flips the color of node 333. The colors are now BWW.\nThen the correct adjacency matrix is guessed.'
