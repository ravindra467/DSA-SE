b"Problem\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef Dobby loves playing games, especially games related to numbers. So, today Bhuvan gave him a new game. The description of the game goes as follows : \nConsider an array A of N non-negative integers. You can do the following move any number of times, pick two numbers from the array (x, y), such that x \xe2\x89\xa5 y and convert them into (x - y, 2 * y). The aim of the game is to make the array contains exactly (N - 1) zeros. If Dobby achieves this, after any number of steps, he wins the game.\nBhuvan wants to know the odds to choose an initial array satisfying for every index i, the condition 0 \xe2\x89\xa4 A[i] \xe2\x89\xa4 B[i] where B is given in input and Dobby wins the game with such an array. So please help him counting the number of such arrays, since the answer can be very large, output the answer modulo 109 + 7.\nInput section\nThe first line contains N, denoting the number of elements in the array.\nNext line contains N space separated integers, denoting the elements of the array.\nOutput section\nOutput the number of possible winning arrays modulo 109 + 7.\nInput constraints\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 50\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 B[i] \xe2\x89\xa4 50, where B[i] denotes the ith element of the array.\n\nSample Input\n3\n2 0 1\n\nSample Output\n4\n\nExplanation\nThe possible winning arrays are (1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1), (2, 0, 0) and (1, 0, 1).\nLet us consider why array (2, 0, 1) is losing. The only move is 2 pick the pair (2, 1). After applying the operation, we get the pair (1, 2). Thus, only the order of elements in the array change and we are in a situation of deadlock. Thus, Chef Dobby can't convert the array to contain 2 zeros."
