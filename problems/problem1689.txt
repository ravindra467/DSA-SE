b'Problem\nThe Cricket World Cup 2015 is nearing and it will be held in Australia and New Zealand. The organizing committee is planning to give a welcome gift to each team member. After careful thought and planning, they have decided on Matryoshka dolls.\xc2\xa0 A Matryoshka doll refers to a set of wooden dolls of strictly decreasing size, placed one inside the other. Any doll can contain only one doll directly inside it. Given the sizes of N dolls, output "YES" if it is possible to nest them all and have one doll on the outside and "NO" otherwise. Input - The input starts with T denoting the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains N, which is the total number of dolls. The second line contains N space separated integers denoting the size of the dolls. Output -\xc2\xa0 Print \xe2\x80\x9cYES\xe2\x80\x9d if the dolls can be nested inside each other and \xe2\x80\x9cNO\xe2\x80\x9d otherwise. (quotes for clarity) Constraints - 1 <= T <= 100 1 <= N <= 100 1 <= doll size <= 1000 Sample Input -\xc2\xa0 3 3 3 1 1 2\xc2\xa0 1 2 4 10 2 5 3 \xc2\xa0 Sample Output - NO YES YES Explanation - For the first case, there are 2 dolls of size 1 and hence cannot be nested inside each other. For the second case, the doll with size 1 can be put inside the doll with size 2. '
