b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nAn even sequence has the following property: each maximal contiguous subsequence which contains only equal integers (i.e. the same integer repeated a number of times) has an even length. In particular, the empty sequence is even. A subsequence is maximal if it is not contained in a larger contiguous subsequence which contains only equal integers.\nChef was given an integer sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b by his friend Mr. Z. He may perform the following operation any number of times: either delete an element of the current sequence (if it is non-empty) or insert an integer anywhere in the current sequence (possibly at the beginning or at the end).\nFind the minimum number of operations needed to make the sequence even.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of operations.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq T \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq A_i \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid iii\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851062 \\cdot 10^62\xe2\x8b\x85106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): N\xe2\x89\xa418N \\leq 18N\xe2\x89\xa418\nSubtask #2 (10 points): Ai\xe2\x89\xa4Ai+1A_i \\leq A_{i+1}Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4Ai+1\xe2\x80\x8b for each valid iii\nSubtask #3 (20 points): N\xe2\x89\xa43,000N \\leq 3,000N\xe2\x89\xa43,000\nSubtask #4 (20 points): Ai\xe2\x89\xa426A_i \\leq 26Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa426 for each valid iii\nSubtask #5 (40 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n4\n1 1 2 1\n11\n2 2 2 10 2 10 1 1 5 3 52\n3\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: Here are two ways to make the sequence even using 222 operations:\n\nDelete the first element 111 and the only element 222, resulting in a sequence (1,1)(1, 1)(1,1), which is even.\nDelete the last element 111 and insert 222 at the end, resulting in a sequence (1,1,2,2)(1,1,2,2)(1,1,2,2), which is even.\n\nIt can be proved that one operation is not enough to make the initial sequence even.'
