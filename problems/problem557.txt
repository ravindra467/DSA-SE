Then the testcases follow.\nFirst line of each testcase contains of a single line of input, an integer N.\nSecond line of each testcase contains N integers h[0],h[1],...,h[N\xe2\x88\x921] separated by a single space.The height of flower plants.\nThird line of each testcase contains N integers b[0],b[1],...,b[N\xe2\x88\x921] separated by a single space.The beauty of flower plants.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line answer the maximum possible sum of the beauties of the remaining flower plants.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq T \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41042\\leq N \\leq 10^42\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4hi\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq hi\\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4hi\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq bi \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSample Input:\n1\n4\n3 1 4 2\n10 20 30 40\nSample Output:\n60\r\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nWe should keep the second and fourth flowers from the left.
