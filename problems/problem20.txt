b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef is given a sequence of prime numbers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b. This sequence has exactly 2N2^N2N subsequences. A subsequence of AAA is good if it does not contain any two identical numbers; in particular, the empty sequence is good.\nChef has to find the number of good subsequences which contain at most KKK numbers. Since he does not know much about subsequences, help him find the answer. This number could be very large, so compute it modulo 1,000,000,0071,000,000,0071,000,000,007.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers NNN and KKK.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the number of good subsequences with size at most KKK, modulo 1,000,000,0071,000,000,0071,000,000,007.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le K \\le N \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa48,0002 \\le A_i \\le 8,0002\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa48,000 for each valid iii\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (40 points): A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b are pairwise distinct\nSubtask #2 (60 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput5 3\n2 2 3 3 518\nExplanation:\nThere is 111 good subsequence with length 000, 555 good subsequences with length 111, 888 good subsequences with length 222 and 444 good subsequences with length 333.'
