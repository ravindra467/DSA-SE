b"Problem\nJashan had been playing Minecraft for a while. It is a game where everything is in the form of cubic blocks (no curves). He thought of making a new mountainous terrain having his own rules in which the blocks are placed. The rules are-\n\nThe mountain is in the form of an array of N\xc3\x97MN \\times MN\xc3\x97M dimensions.\nEach element of the array represents the height of the mountain at that point.\nThe height of the mountain increases or remains the same along the row i.e. non-decreasing.\nThe first element of every row will have a greater or equal height than the previous row's greatest element.\n\nHe went to make the terrain with his dog and started coming back down after completing it. Unfortunately, he slipped from the slope and fell down to the point where he started (0,0)(0, 0)(0,0). His dog got detached from its collar and remained on the block he fell from.\nNow, he has to teleport to the block his dog is on to bring it back. The only way to reach his dog is to know the coordinates of that block. After the fall, Jashan vaguely remembers the QQQ heights he possibly fell down from but not the coordinates. Help him find the coordinates of each of the QQQ heights. It is guaranteed that a block of the given height always exists. If there are multiple coordinates with the same height, report the first coordinate that comes in the row-major order.\n\n### Input:\n- The first line has an integer TTT denoting the number of test cases.\n- The first line of each test case has three integers NNN, MMM, QQQ.\n- The next NNN lines have MMM space-separated integers representing the height HHH of each point on the mountain.\n- Then QQQ lines follow which list out the possible heights.\n\n### Output:\nFor each test case, output QQQ lines of space-separated integers which are the possible coordinates of the point on the mountain where the dog is present.\nIf there are multiple coordinates with the same height, report the first coordinate that comes in the row-major order.\n\n### Constraints \n- 1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq T \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n- 1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41021 \\leq N, M \\leq 10^21\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4102\n- 1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq Q\\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n- 1\xe2\x89\xa4H\xe2\x89\xa41081 \\leq H \\leq 10^81\xe2\x89\xa4H\xe2\x89\xa4108\n\n### Subtasks\n- Subtask #1 (40 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\leq Q \\leq 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4103\n- Subtask #3 (60 points): Original Constraints\n\n### Sample Input:\n    2\n    3 3 3\n    1 2 3\n    4 5 6\n    7 8 9\n    5\n    8\n    1\n    2 2 3\n    1 2\n    2 2\n    2\n    1\n    2\n\n### Sample Output:\n    1 1\n    2 1\n    0 0\n    0 1\n    0 0\n    0 1\n\n### EXPLANATION:\nFor the first matrix, block with height 555 is present at (1,1)(1, 1)(1,1) on the mountain. Similarly, blocks with heights 888 and 111 are present at (2,1)(2, 1)(2,1) and (0,0)(0, 0)(0,0) respectively.\nFor the second matrix, block with height 222 is present at (0,1)(0, 1)(0,1) on the mountain. Similarly, block with height 111 is present at (0,0)(0, 0)(0,0). Note that even though there are 333 occurrences of height 222 in second matrix, only first occurring coordinate in row-major order as output will be considered valid."
