b"Problem\nYou are given a set SSS of NNN distinct integer points in the 2D2D2D plane. Initially, each point has a color, either red or green.\nYou have to perform some number of operations (possibly 000) on this set of points such that all points are green after all operations.\nAn operation is:\n\nChoose some line that does not pass through any of the points in SSS. This line should also not pass through the origin.\nThe line divides the space into two half-planes. Let QQQ be the set of all points in SSS that are also in the same half-plane as the origin.\nFlip the colors of all the points in QQQ. That is, if a point in QQQ had the color red then it becomes green and vice versa.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of operations that need to be done to convert all the points to green color?\nIt can be proven that it's always possible to convert any set of colored points to the green color in a finite number of operations.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN - the size of SSS.\nThe next line contains a string of length NNN where the iii-th character of the string is R\\texttt{R}R if the iii-th point is red and G\\texttt{G}G if it's green.\nThe iii-th line of next NNN lines contains two integers xi,yix_i, y_ixi\xe2\x80\x8b,yi\xe2\x80\x8b - the coordinates of the iii-th point of set SSS.\n\nOutput Format\n\nFor every test case, you must print the minimum number of operations needed to convert all points to green color.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4171 \\le N \\le 171\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa417\n\xe2\x88\x92106\xe2\x89\xa4xi,yi\xe2\x89\xa4106-10^6 \\leq x_i,y_i \\leq 10^6\xe2\x88\x92106\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x80\x8b,yi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4106\n(xi,yi)\xe2\x89\xa0(0,0)(x_i, y_i) \\neq (0,0)(xi\xe2\x80\x8b,yi\xe2\x80\x8b)\xee\x80\xa0=(0,0) for all iii\nAll points are pairwise distinct\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput9\nRRGRGGRGR\n2 -4\n-9 5\n-2 -1\n-6 2\n7 -2\n-9 -6\n3 -5\n5 0\n0 -3\n2\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe below image explains the operations needed.
