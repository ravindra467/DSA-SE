b'Problem\nThere are total NNN cars in a sequence with ithithith car being assigned with an alphabet equivalent to the ithithith alphabet of string SSS . Chef has been assigned a task to calculate the total number of cars with alphabet having a unique even value in the given range X to Y (both inclusive)\n. The value of an alphabet is simply its position in alphabetical order e.g.: a=1, b=2, c=3\xe2\x80\xa6\nThe chef will be given QQQ\r\nsuch tasks having varying values of XXX and YYY\nNote: string SSS contains only lowercase alphabets\nInput\nFirst line of input contains a string SSS of length NNN.\nSecond line contains an integer denoting no. of queries QQQ.\nNext q lines contain two integers denoting values of XXX and YYY.\nOutput\nFor each query print a single integer denoting total number of cars with alphabet having a unique even value in the given range XXX to YYY.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq n \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq q \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\nExample Input\nbbccdd\r\n5\r\n1 2\r\n3 4\r\n5 6\r\n1 6\r\n2 5\n\nExample Output\n1\r\n0\r\n1\r\n2\r\n2\n\nExplanation:\nExample case 1:\nQuery 1: range 1 to 2 contains the substring "bb""bb""bb" where each character has a value of 2. Since we will only be considering unique even values, the output will be 1'
