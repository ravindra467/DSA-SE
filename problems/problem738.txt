Then the test cases follow.\nEach test case contains of a single line of input, six integers PPP, aaa, bbb, ccc, xxx and yyy.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output in a single line the maximum total of Anars and Chakris Chef can light up.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq T \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4P,a,b,c,x,y\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq P, a, b, c, x, y \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4P,a,b,c,x,y\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n100 5 5 10 4 8\n16 2 2 2 1 1\n55 1 2 3 4 54\n4\n9\nExplanation:\nTest case 111:\n\nChef will buy 161616 Fuljhari's and 444 Anar's which in total costs him 16\xe2\x8b\x855+4\xe2\x8b\x855=10016 \\cdot 5 + 4 \\cdot 5 = 10016\xe2\x8b\x855+4\xe2\x8b\x855=100 rupees.\nNext, he uses 161616 Fuljhari's to light 164=4\\frac{16}{4} = 4416\xe2\x80\x8b=4 Anar's.\nSince all the Fuljhari's are over, he can't light up any Chakri's.\nSo in total, he is able to light up 4+0=44 + 0 = 44+0=4 Anar's and Chakri's.\nThere is no other allocation giving a better answer than this.\n\nTest case 222:\n\nChef will buy 444 Fuljhari's, 222 Anar's and 222 Chakri's which in total costs him 4\xe2\x8b\x852+2\xe2\x8b\x852+2\xe2\x8b\x852=164 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 2 = 164\xe2\x8b\x852+2\xe2\x8b\x852+2\xe2\x8b\x852=16 rupees.\nNext, he uses 222 Fuljhari's to light 21=2\\frac{2}{1} = 212\xe2\x80\x8b=2 Anar's.\nNext, he uses 222 Fuljhari's to light 21=2\\frac{2}{1} = 212\xe2\x80\x8b=2 Chakri's.\nSo in total, he is able to light up 2+2=42 + 2 = 42+2=4 Anar's and Chakri's.\nThe other possible allocation could be buying 444 Fuljhari's, 333 Anar's, and 111 Chakri.\n"
