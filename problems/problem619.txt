b'Problem\nThis morning Chef woke up with an uncontrollable urge to send a text message. But, can you believe it? His new phone just crashed and all of the words are missing from its dictionary! There used to be NNN words in there, and he certainly doesn\'t have time to add all of them back right now.\nHis plan is to just choose KKK distinct words of the NNN possible words, add them to the phone\'s dictionary, and then text each of them. To text a certain word, he must either type the word itself, or any nonempty prefix of it which is not a prefix of any other word in the dictionary.\nCan you help chef find out the minimum number of letters he must type to send the message of KKK words?\nInput Format\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nFor each testcase, the first line contains space-separated integers NNN and KKK.\nThen, NNN lines follow, each containing a word that used to be in the phone\'s dictionary.\n\nOutput Format\n\nFor the iii-th test case, print a line containing "Test Case #i: "  followed by the minimum number of characters Chef needs to type to send the text message.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4201 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 201\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa420\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa44,0002 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 4,0002\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa44,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4min(N\xe2\x88\x921,100)1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 min(N-1, 100)1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4min(N\xe2\x88\x921,100)\nThe NNN words will have a total length of no more than 20,000 characters.\nThe words are made up of only lower-case alphabetic characters.\nThe words are pairwise distinct.\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n6 4\ntin\ntiny\ntinny\ngigantic\ntilt\ntilts\n3 2\napple\napricot\ncherry\n5 3\na\naa\naaa\naaaa\naaaaaTest Case #1: 11\nTest Case #2: 2\nTest Case #3: 6\nExplanation:\nIn the first case, one option is to choose the words "tin", "tinny", "gigantic", and "tilts". You can then text these words by typing "tin", "tinn", "g", and "til", respectively, for a total of 3+4+1+3=11 letters.'
