b"Problem\nRam has recently won a lottery of 1 billion Simalokolan-Dollars.\nAnd he has bought a huge mansion with half of the lottery amount.\nNow he has hired NNN maids (numbered from 111 to NNN) to take care of the mansion!\nEach maid has her report card from National Housekeeper Examination!\nThe report card of each maid has 3 different fields - Vacuuming skills , Laundry skills and Dish-washing skills.\nEach maid has got a score for each of the different skills;\nRam will assign each maid only one type of task i.e Vacuuming or Laundry or Dish-washing.\nNo maid shall do more than one type of task.\nAlso, Ram got to know that for each i\xe2\x88\x88[1,N\xe2\x88\x921]i \\in [1,N-1]i\xe2\x88\x88[1,N\xe2\x88\x921],  ithi^{th}ith maid is friend of (i+1)th(i+1)^{th}(i+1)th maid.\nRam also knows that if he assign both ithi^{th}ith and (i+1)th(i+1)^{th}(i+1)th maid the same type of task then they will gossip all day and not work properly.\nSo Ram won't assign them same type of task i.e tasks given to ithi^{th}ith and (i+1)th(i+1)^{th}(i+1)th maid shall not be same.\nLet Assigned score of the ithi^{th}ith maid be equal to the score on her report card for the type of task she's assigned.\nNow Ram wonders what is the maximum total assigned score he can get.\n### Input:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nThe first line of each testcase contains an integer NNN denoting the number of maids.\nThe second line contains NNN space separated integers where the ithi^{th}ith integer denotes the Vacuuming skills score of ithi^{th}ith maid.\nThe third line contains NNN space separated integers where the ithi^{th}ith integer denotes the Laundry skills score of ithi^{th}ith maid.\nThe fourth line contains NNN space separated integers where the ithi^{th}ith integer denotes the Dish-Washing skills score of ithi^{th}ith maid.\n\n### Output:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line the maximum total assigned score Ram can get.\n### Constraints \n- 1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\leq T \\leq 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n- 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n- The Vacuuming skill score for each maid doesn't exceed 10510^5105.\n- The Laundry skill score for each maid doesn't exceed 10510^5105\n- The Dish-Washing skill score for each maid doesn't exceed 10510^5105\n- Sum of NNN over all test cases doesn't exceed 10510^5105\n### Sample Input:\n\t1\n\t3\n\t3 2 1\n\t2 3 1\n\t1 2 3 \n\t### Sample Output:\n\t9### EXPLANATION:\nRam can assign Vacuuming to 1st maid and Laundry to 2nd maid and Dish-washing to 3rd maid.\nThis assignment will give a total score of 3+3+3=9 score."
