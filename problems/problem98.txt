b"Problem\nThere is a line consisting of NNN piles of coins on the table. For each iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq i \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the iii-th pile contains CiC_iCi\xe2\x80\x8b coins, each with value ViV_iVi\xe2\x80\x8b. There is also a bin under the table.\nAlice and Bob play a game, moving alternately. A move consists of two steps:\n\nThrow a prefix of the piles in the bin (the prefix can be empty). Then, if there are no coins left on the table, the game ends. Note that in this step, it is not allowed to throw away only some coins in a pile \xe2\x80\x94 the entire pile must be thrown into the bin.\nTake exactly one coin from the first (remaining) pile. Then, if there are no coins left on the table, the game ends.\n\nLet AAA and BBB be the sum of the values of the coins taken by Alice and Bob, respectively.\nThe score of the game is A\xe2\x88\x92BA - BA\xe2\x88\x92B. Alice wants to maximize the score; Bob wants to minimize it.\nAlice moves first. What's the score of the game if Alice and Bob play optimally?\nPlease look at the sample cases below for an example of how the game is played.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer TTT, the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\nEach test cases consists of three lines of input.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN, the number of piles of coins.\nThe second line of each test case contains NNN space-separated integers C1,C2,\xe2\x80\xa6,CNC_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_NC1\xe2\x80\x8b,C2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,CN\xe2\x80\x8b: CiC_iCi\xe2\x80\x8b is the number of coins in the iii-th pile.\nThe third line of each test case contains NNN space-separated integers V1,V2,\xe2\x80\xa6,VNV_1, V_2, \\ldots, V_NV1\xe2\x80\x8b,V2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,VN\xe2\x80\x8b: ViV_iVi\xe2\x80\x8b is the value of each coin in the iii-th pile.\n\n\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print on a new line a single integer: the final value of A\xe2\x88\x92BA - BA\xe2\x88\x92B, if Alice and Bob play optimally.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\le T \\le 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4104\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851052 \\le N \\le 2 \\cdot 10^52\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ci\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq C_i \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Ci\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Vi\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq V_i \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Vi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052 \\cdot 10^52\xe2\x8b\x85105.\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n6\n1 2 5 1 1 3\n38 46 66 64 59 69\n6\n2 5 4 1 1 2\n49 24 17 54 23 50\n2\n4 2\n32 78\n69\n31\n0\n\nExplanation:\nTest case 111: An optimal strategy for Alice and Bob is the following:\n\nInitially, the piles, denoted by (Ci,Vi)(C_i, V_i)(Ci\xe2\x80\x8b,Vi\xe2\x80\x8b), are ((1,38),(2,46),(5,66),(1,64),(1,59),(3,69))((1, 38), (2, 46), (5, 66), (1, 64), (1, 59), (3, 69))((1,38),(2,46),(5,66),(1,64),(1,59),(3,69)).\nAlice throws the first 555 piles in the bin.
