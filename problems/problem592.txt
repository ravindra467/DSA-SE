b'Problem\nA lot of people participating in a contest are obsessed with looking at the leaderboard to see how they are doning (Even you might have checked it just now. Hope you are doing well :P).\nConsidering there are NNN teams participating and there are MMM problems in the contest. What would be the expected number of problems solved by the team at rank KKK on the leaderboard?\nIf the expected value is P/Q{P/Q}P/Q you must print the value P\xe2\x88\x97Q\xe2\x88\x921%MOD{P*Q^{-1} \\% MOD}P\xe2\x88\x97Q\xe2\x88\x921%MOD, where MOD=109+7{MOD=10^9 + 7}MOD=109+7.\nInput\n\nFirst line contains TTT, number of test case,\nFor each test case, you are given 333 space seperated integers NNN, MMM and KKK.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print the desired answer.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410{1 \\leq T \\leq 10}1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4109{1 \\leq K \\leq N \\leq 10^9}1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa450{1 \\leq M \\leq 50}1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa450\n\nSample Input\n2\r\n1 1 1\r\n2 2 2\n\nSample Output\n500000004\r\n545454550\n\nExplanation\nFor the first test case, there can be only 222 possiblities(Here SSS represents solved and UUU represents unsolved) -\nUUU\nSSS\nTherefore expected number of problems solved by rank 111 = 1\xe2\x88\x97(1/2)+0\xe2\x88\x97(1/2)=1/21*(1/2)+ 0*(1/2) = 1/21\xe2\x88\x97(1/2)+0\xe2\x88\x97(1/2)=1/2\nFor the second example there can be 111111 possibilities -\n222 problems solved by rank 222 -\nSSSSSS\nSSSSSS\n111 problem solved by rank 222 -\nSSSSSS\nSUSUSU\nSSSSSS\nUSUSUS\nSUSUSU\nSUSUSU\nSUSUSU\nUSUSUS\nUSUSUS\nSUSUSU\nUSUSUS\nUSUSUS\n000 problem solved by rank 222 -\nSUSUSU\nUUUUUU\nUSUSUS\nUUUUUU\nUUUUUU\nUUUUUU\nSSSSSS\nUUUUUU\nTherefore expected number of problems solved by rank 222 - 0\xe2\x88\x97(4/11)+1\xe2\x88\x97(6/11)+2\xe2\x88\x97(1/11)=8/110*(4/11) + 1*(6/11) + 2*(1/11) = 8/110\xe2\x88\x97(4/11)+1\xe2\x88\x97(6/11)+2\xe2\x88\x97(1/11)=8/11'
