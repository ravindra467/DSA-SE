b'Problem\n\xc2\xa0\nArnab is the programming contest trainer for the student of AUST ( Awesome University for Super Talent ) . But he is really disappointed with the behavior of the contestants as they are not very willing to do class or learn new things .  So he decided to set a  problem on new topic in Intra AUST Programming contest that they will learn this topic through reading the problem statement . We asked him about the problem and fortunately he shared his problem with us . \n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0Euler circuit is a path that starts from any node ,  uses every edge of a graph exactly once and then finishes at same starting node .  In this Problem there is given a graph with \xe2\x80\x98V\xe2\x80\x99 vertexes and \xe2\x80\x98E\xe2\x80\x99 edges .  Your task is to find there exists a euler circuit  or not . If so then print \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d otherwise print \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x9d . \n\xc2\xa0\nAlgorithm to detect Euler Circuit  :  \n\nGraph should be connected \nDegree of every vertex should be even . Degree of a vertex means total incoming and outgoing edge of a vertex .  \n\nInput\nInput starts with an integer T ( 1 <= 30 ) , number of test cases . Each test case consists of two integer n ( 1 <= n <= 500 ) and m ( 1 <= m <= 10000 ) where n is the number of nodes and m is number of edges between these nodes . Following m lines contain two integer u and v . There is a bi-directional edge between u and v . \nOutput\nFor each test case first print the case number and then print \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d if there exist an Euler circuit otherwise print \xe2\x80\x9cNo\xe2\x80\x9d . \nConstraints\n\n1 <= T <=  30\n1 <=  n  <=  500 \n1 <=  m  <=  10000 \n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n4 4\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 1\n4 4\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 2\nOutput:\nCase 1: Yes\nCase 2: No\n\xc2\xa0'
