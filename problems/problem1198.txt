b"Problem\n\xc2\xa0\nProblem description\nIn a meeting Monti is given a binary string of N characters. A binary string is string consisting of only 0's and 1's. Monti can swap any adjacent pair of characters in one operation. Monti has to bring at least M 1's together starting at any position of the string. Help him count the minimum number of operations required to do so.\nIt is guaranteed that there are at least M 1's present in the given string.\nInput\nFirst line contains single integer T. Number of test cases.\nNext 2 * T lines represent T test cases. Each test case is described by two lines; first line contains a single integer M and the second line contains the input binary string.\nOutput\nOutput T lines, one for each test case containing the answer for that case.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 50000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n\nSum of N over all the cases if less than or equal to 50000\nExample\nInput:\n2\n3\n101001\n2\n101001\nOutput:\n3\n1\n"
