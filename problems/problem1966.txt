b"Problem\nRead problems statements Mandarin , Bengali , Hindi , Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a 1\xc3\x971\xc3\x9721 \\times 1 \\times 21\xc3\x971\xc3\x972 bar (a cuboid) and a grid AAA with NNN rows (numbered 111 through NNN) and MMM columns (numbered 111 through MMM). Let's denote the cell in row rrr and column ccc by (r,c)(r, c)(r,c). Some cells of the grid are blocked, the remaining cells are free.\nEach cell has dimensions 1\xc3\x9711 \\times 11\xc3\x971, the same as two opposite faces of the cuboid. When the bar is placed on the grid in such a way that one of its two 1\xc3\x9711 \\times 11\xc3\x971 faces fully covers a cell (r,c)(r, c)(r,c), we say that the bar is standing on the cell (r,c)(r, c)(r,c). Initially, the bar is standing on a cell (x,y)(x, y)(x,y).\nWhen the bar is placed on the grid, one of its faces is touching the grid; this face is called the base. In one move, you must roll the bar over one of its base edges (sides of the base); this base edge does not move and the bar is rotated 90\xe2\x88\x9890^\\circ90\xe2\x88\x98 around it in such a way that it is still lying on the grid, but with a different base. In different moves, the bar may be rotated around different edges in different directions. After each move, the base of the bar must lie fully inside the grid and it must not cover any blocked cells.\nAn example sequence of moves is shown here.\nFor each cell of the grid, determine the minimum number of moves necessary to achieve the state where the bar is standing on this cell or determine that it is impossible to achieve.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and MMM.\nThe second line contains two space-separated integers xxx and yyy.\nNNN lines follow. For each iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le i \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the iii-th of these lines contains MMM integers Ai,1,Ai,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ai,MA_{i, 1}, A_{i, 2}, \\ldots, A_{i, M}Ai,1\xe2\x80\x8b,Ai,2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ai,M\xe2\x80\x8b (a string with length MMM). For each valid i,ji, ji,j, Ai,j=0A_{i, j} = 0Ai,j\xe2\x80\x8b=0 denotes that the cell (i,j)(i, j)(i,j) is blocked and Ai,j=1A_{i, j} = 1Ai,j\xe2\x80\x8b=1 denotes that it is free.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print NNN lines, each containing MMM space-separated integers. For each valid i,ji, ji,j, the jjj-th integer on the iii-th of these lines should denote the minimum number of moves necessary to have the bar stand on cell (i,j)(i, j)(i,j), or it should be \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4501 \\le T \\le 501\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa450\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le N, M \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le x \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4y\xe2\x89\xa4M1 \\le y \\le M1\xe2\x89\xa4y\xe2\x89\xa4M\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,j\xe2\x89\xa410 \\le A_{i, j} \\le 10\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,j\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa41 for each valid i,ji, ji,j\nAx,y=1A_{x, y} = 1Ax,y\xe2\x80\x8b=1\nthe sum of N\xe2\x8b\x85MN \\cdot MN\xe2\x8b\x85M over all test cases does not exceed 10610^6106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (15 points):\n\nx=1x = 1x=1\ny=1y = 1y=1\nAi,j=1A_{i, j} = 1Ai,j\xe2\x80\x8b=1 for each valid i,ji, ji,j\n\nSubtask #2 (85 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n2 4\n1 1\n1111\n0111\n2 4\n1 1\n1111\n00110 -1 -1 2\n-1 -1 -1 3\n0 -1 -1 2\n-1 -1 -1 -1\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: Initially, the base of the bar occupies the cell (1,1)(1, 1)(1,1). After the first move, it occupies the cells (1,2)(1, 2)(1,2) and (1,3)(1, 3)(1,3). After the second move, it can occupy the cell (1,4)(1, 4)(1,4).\nAlternatively, after the second move, it can occupy the cells (2,2)(2, 2)(2,2) and (2,3)(2, 3)(2,3), and after the third move, it can occupy the cell (2,4)(2, 4)(2,4)."
