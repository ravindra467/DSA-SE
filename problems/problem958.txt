b'Problem\nChef in association with Netaji Subhash Engineering College , decided to conduct a coding contest CODE-O-WAR for its students , to overcome the boredom during the Quarantine .\nThere are NNN students in the college. The number of students is even. The ithi^{th}ith student has programming skill equal to AiA_{i}Ai\xe2\x80\x8b.\nChef wants to form N/2N/2N/2 teams with certain restrictions which goes as :\n\n\nEach team should consist of exactly two students, and each student should belong to exactly one team.\n\n\nTwo students can form a team only if their skills are equal .\n\n\nStudents can solve problems to increase their skill. One solved problem increases the skill by one.\nChef wants to know the minimum total number of problems students should solve to form exactly N/2N/2N/2 teams (i.e. each pair of students should form a team). Your task is to help Chef in finding out the minimum number of problems to be solved.\nInput:\n\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\n\n\nEach testcase contains of a single line of input, an integers NNN.\n\n\nNext line contains NNN space integer AiA_{i}Ai\xe2\x80\x8b,denoting skills of ithi^{th}ith student.\n\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, print the minimum no. of problems to be solved .\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq T \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45002 \\leq N \\leq 5002\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4500\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41000001 \\leq A_{i} \\leq 100000 1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4100000\nNN N  is always Even\n\nSample Input:\n   1\r\n   2 \r\n   1 100\n\nSample Output:\n    99\n'
