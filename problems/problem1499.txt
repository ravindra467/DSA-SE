b'Problem\nYou are given an undirected graph G = (V, E) containing N nodes and M edges. The nodes are numbered from 1 to N. A subset C of V is a vertex cover if for every edge (u, v) \xe2\x88\x88 E, at least one of u and v belong to C. Note that C = V is always a vertex cover.\nConsider a partition of V into two sets A and B. It is said to be a valid partition, if the following two conditions are satisfied: A should be a vertex cover. And for each i such that 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 n/2, nodes 2*i and 2*i - 1 don\'t belong to the same set (i.e. one belongs to set A and the other to set B).\nDetermine if a valid partition exists. If it exists, provide an example of one valid partition.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M denoting the number of nodes and number of edges in the graph respectively.\nEach of the following M lines contains two space-separated integers u and v denoting an edge between nodes u and v.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a line containing the string "possible" (without quotes) if a solution exists or "impossible" otherwise. \nIf a solution exists, print a second line containing a binary string. The i-th character of this string should be \'0\' if vertex i is in set B or \'1\' if it is in set A. \n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 2 \xc2\xb7 105\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 2 \xc2\xb7 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 u, v \xe2\x89\xa4 N \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 sum of N over all test cases \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 sum of M over all test cases \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n3 2\n1 2\n2 3\n4 5\n1 3\n2 4\n1 4\n1 2\n2 3\nOutput:\npossible\n011\nimpossible\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: We can put nodes numbered 2 and 3 in set A and node 1 in set B. Note that this is a valid partition because set A is a vertex cover; also, nodes numbered 1 and 2 belong to different sets.\nExample case 2: There exists no partition which satisfies the conditions.'
