He draws NNN lines (numbered 111 through NNN) in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system; for each valid iii, the iii-th line is drawn with the cic_ici\xe2\x80\x8b-th pencil and it is described by the equation y=ai\xe2\x8b\x85x+biy = a_i \\cdot x + b_iy=ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x8b\x85x+bi\xe2\x80\x8b.\nNow, infinitepro calls a triangle truly-geometric if each of its sides is part of some line he drew and all three sides have the same colour. He wants to count these triangles, but there are too many of them! After a lot of consideration, he decided to erase a subset of the NNN lines he drew. He wants to do it with his eraser, which has length KKK.\nWhenever erasing a line with a colour iii, the length of the eraser decreases by ViV_iVi\xe2\x80\x8b. In other words, when the eraser has length kkk and we use it to erase a line with a colour iii, the length of the eraser decreases to k\xe2\x88\x92Vik-V_ik\xe2\x88\x92Vi\xe2\x80\x8b; if k<Vik \\lt V_ik<Vi\xe2\x80\x8b, it is impossible to erase such a line.\nSince infinitepro has to study for the re-exam, he wants to minimise the number of truly-geometric triangles. Can you help him find the minimum possible number of truly-geometric triangles which can be obtained by erasing a subset of the NNN lines in an optimal way? He promised a grand treat for you if he passes the examination!\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers NNN, CCC and KKK.\nNNN lines follow. For each iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le i \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the iii-th of these lines contains three space-separated integers aia_iai\xe2\x80\x8b, bib_ibi\xe2\x80\x8b and cic_ici\xe2\x80\x8b.\nThe last line contains CCC space-separated integers V1,V2,\xe2\x80\xa6,VCV_1, V_2, \\ldots, V_CV1\xe2\x80\x8b,V2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,VC\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the smallest possible number of truly-geometric triangles after erasing lines.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\le T \\le 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4C\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa43,0001 \\le C \\le N \\le 3,0001\xe2\x89\xa4C\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa43,000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa43,0000 \\le K \\le 3,0000\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa43,000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4ai,bi\xe2\x89\xa41090 \\le a_i, b_i \\le 10^90\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x80\x8b,bi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid iii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa4C1 \\le c_i \\le C1\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4C for each valid iii\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Vi\xe2\x89\xa4K0 \\le V_i \\le K0\xe2\x89\xa4Vi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4K for each valid iii\nno two lines coincide, regardless of their colours\nno three lines are concurrent\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points):\n\nN\xe2\x89\xa410N \\le 10N\xe2\x89\xa410\nK\xe2\x89\xa4100K \\le 100K\xe2\x89\xa4100\n\nSubtask 2 (15 points):\n\nV1=V2=\xe2\x80\xa6=VCV_1 = V_2 = \\ldots = V_CV1\xe2\x80\x8b=V2\xe2\x80\x8b=\xe2\x80\xa6=VC\xe2\x80\x8b\nno two lines are parallel\n\nSubtask #3 (25 points): no two lines are parallel\nSubtask #4 (50 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n7 2 13\n1 10 1\n1 14 2\n6 4 1\n2 2 1\n0 12 2\n2 11 2\n0 6 1\n8 10\n6 1 20\n1 5 1\n2 11 1\n4 0 1\n6 8 1\n0 11 1\n3 3 1\n92\n4\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: We can remove exactly one line. Initially, we have 555 truly geometric triangles (see the image below; red is colour 111 and green is colour 222).\n\nRemoving any line with colour 222 brings the total number of truly-geometric triangles down to 4+0=44+0=44+0=4.\nRemoving any line with colour 111 brings the total number of truly-geometric triangles down to 1+1=21+1=21+1=2.\n\nThus, the smallest number of truly-geometric triangles we can obtain is 222.\n\nExample case 2: We can remove at most 222 lines and removing any 222 lines gives us a total of 444 truly-geometric triangles.'
