b"Problem\nIt's time for the annual Tug of War tournament in the city of Simalokolo!\nAnd the Mayor of the city , Mr.Ram , was bored of seeing the long tournament every year!\nSo he decided that this year instead of the whole tournament , only one match will be conducted !\nAnd he also has decided some strange rules for the match !\nThe rules are as follows:\n\nEvery citizen of the city has to participate in the match!\nFor every pair of citizen AAA and BBB , if AAA and BBB hold a grudge against each other then they won't be in the same team.\n\nThe city of Simalokolo has NNN citizens numbered from 111 to NNN.\nAnd each citizen holds a grudge against 000 or more people.\nObviously, no citizen holds a grudge against himself/herself!\nYou are given the data about the citizens and the grudges.\nFind out if organizing the match is possible or not !\n### Input:\n- First line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\n- The first line of each test case will have NNN , number of citizens in the city and KKK , the number of grudges.\n- The next KKK lines will have two integers AAA and BBB , denoting AAA and BBB hold grudge against each other.\n- It is guarenteed that the KKK pairs are distinct , i.e , for any two pairs P1P1P1 and P2P2P2 , it is guarenteed that (P1A,P1B)\xe2\x89\xa0(P2A,P2B)(P1_A,P1_B) \\neq (P2_A,P2_B)(P1A\xe2\x80\x8b,P1B\xe2\x80\x8b)\xee\x80\xa0\xe2\x80\x8b=(P2A\xe2\x80\x8b,P2B\xe2\x80\x8b) and (P1A,P1B)\xe2\x89\xa0(P2B,P2A)(P1_A,P1_B) \\neq (P2_B,P2_A)(P1A\xe2\x80\x8b,P1B\xe2\x80\x8b)\xee\x80\xa0\xe2\x80\x8b=(P2B\xe2\x80\x8b,P2A\xe2\x80\x8b).\n### Output:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line 'possible' if organizing the match is possible or 'impossible' if there's no way to organize the match according to the rules set by the Mayor.\n### Constraints \n- 1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq T \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n- 2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41052 \\leq N \\leq 10^52\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n- 1\xe2\x89\xa4A,B\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq A,B \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4A,B\xe2\x89\xa4N\n- 0\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4min(105,N\xe2\x88\x97(N\xe2\x88\x921)/2)0 \\leq K \\leq min(10^5,N*(N-1)/2)0\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4min(105,N\xe2\x88\x97(N\xe2\x88\x921)/2)\n- The sum of NNN over all test cases doesn't exceed 10510^5105.\n- The sum of KKK over all test cases doesn't exceed 10510^5105.\n### Sample Input:\n\t2\n\t3 2\n\t1 2\n\t1 3\n\t3 3\n\t1 2\n\t1 3\n\t2 3### Sample Output:\n\tpossible\n\timpossible### EXPLANATION:\nIn the first case, we can put citizen 2 and 3 in one team and citizen 1 in the other team.\t\nIn the second case , there is no way to put all of them in separate teams such that no team will have two members who hold grudge against each other."
