b"Problem\nChef has a Tree with each Node assign with the lower case character between a to z. Chef has borrowed some palindrome from rishabh_singh0.\nNow, rishabh_singh0 needs palindrome back and chef is happy so chef wants to give the longest palindrome he has. Unfortunately, the chef has messed the tree so he wants you to give the length of the largest palindromic path in the tree so that chef can return the palindrome.\npalindromic path means: Take any two Node in Tree if the shortest path between them forms a palindrome then it's the palindromic path\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nEach testcase contains NNN, number of Nodes.\nNext NNN - 111 line contain uuu vvv connecting edges.\nNext line contain string with NNN character in which iii th character represents character assign to iiith Node.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line answer length of Longest Palindromic Path in Tree.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4151 \\leq T \\leq 151\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa415\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa450001 \\leq N \\leq 50001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45000\n\nSample Input:\n1\n3\n1 2\n2 3\nmom\nSample Output:\n3\n"
