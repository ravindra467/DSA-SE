b'Problem\nProblem Statement\nLet us define median of a square matrix M (of size N * N) as the median of the median of all rows. Given a matrix M, find it\xe2\x80\x99s median.\nInput section\nThe first line contains, T, denoting the number of test cases.\nFirst line of each test case consists an integer N, denoting the size of the matrix. Next N lines contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of the matrix.\nAs the test files are upto 17 MB, it is advised to use faster input, output in C++ and Java. Time limit may be too strict for python users. You are advised to use pypy.\nOutput section\nFor each test case, print the median of the matrix, which is the median of the median of all rows.\nInput constraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 1000, N is odd.\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 A[i][j] \xe2\x89\xa4 105, where A[i][j] deontes the element of the matrix in ith row and jth column.\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 (10 points) : 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 3\nSubtask #2 (30 points) : 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100\nSubtask #3 (60 points) : Original Constraints\n\nSample Input\n2\n3\n17526 49346 90822\n51879 9789 38513\n1337 56186 53770\n1\n93538\n\nSample Output\n49346\n93538\n\nFor the first test case, the medians of the rows are {49346, 38513, 53770}. So the overall median of matrix is 49346.'
