b'Problem\n\xc2\xa0\n\nChef has an array A of N elements where each element is in range [0, MAX]. Chef was tired of dancing at the party and decided to partition the array such that each element is in a partition and the partition are subsegments of the array. He also defined a partitioning to be good if in every partition there is at max K unique numbers. Now chef is wondering how many good partitions of the given array exist. Help him calculate this value  mod 1e9 + 7. \n\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\nThe first line of each test case contains a two integers N and K. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the array.\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\nOutput one integer, the number of good partition mod 1e9 + 7.\n\xc2\xa0\nSubtasks\nSubtask 1(20 points): N \xe2\x89\xa4 103,MAX = 104\nSubtask 2(20 points): N \xe2\x89\xa4 103,MAX = 109\nSubtask 3(60 points): N \xe2\x89\xa4 105,MAX = 109\nExample\nInput:\n4 2\n1 2 3 2\nOutput:\n6\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nThe good partitions are as follows: 1|2|3|2, 1|2|3 2, 1|2 3 2, 1|2 3|2, 1 2|3 2, 1 2|3|2'
