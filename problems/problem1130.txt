b'Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.\n\nGiven a list of strings S[\xc2\xa01..N\xc2\xa0], you need to count how many ordered pairs of strings are awesome. Given two integers i and j, such that 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i, j \xe2\x89\xa4 n and i \xe2\x89\xa0 j, an ordered pair (\xc2\xa0S[\xc2\xa0i\xc2\xa0], S[\xc2\xa0j\xc2\xa0]\xc2\xa0) is called awesome if and only if concatenating S[\xc2\xa0i\xc2\xa0] and S[\xc2\xa0j\xc2\xa0] gives a palindrome.\nInput\nThe first line contains an integer T denoting the total number of test cases.\nIn each test case, the first line contains an integer N denoting the total number of strings.\nThen, there are N strings, each in a separate line. They only consist of lower case characters.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the answer.\nConstraints\n\n1 <= T <= 5\nIn each test case,\n1 <= N <= 10^6\nSum of lengths of N strings <= 10^6\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n3\na\nab\nabb2\nExplanation:\nab|a and abb|a'
