b'Problem\nAliceAliceAlice and BobBobBob were fond of playing. One day, AliceAliceAlice came up with a game of power of two. The game is as follows:\n\n\nAliceAliceAlice starts the game.\n\n\nBobBobBob gives Alice a number.\n\n\nIf the number is a power of 222, divide it by 222 and change the turn, else subtract the highest power of 222 and change the turn.\n\n\nContinue until 111 is left.\n\n\nThe person who cannot move further loseslosesloses the game.\n\n### Input:\n-The first line of each input consists of a test case t.\n-In every line of the t lines that follow, is given a number n.\n\n### Output:\n-Output "Alice" if AliceAliceAlice is a winner, else output "Bob".\n\n### Constraints:\n1 <= n <= 2^64 - 1\n1 <= t <= 10\n\n### Sample Input:\n2\n1\n6\n\n### Sample Output:\nBob\nBob\n\n### Explanation :\nIn the first case, since n is already 1, Alice doesn\'t get a chance to play the game. Hence he loses.\nIn the second case, Alice subtracts the highest power of 2 less than 6, which is 4 and gives it to Bob. Now Bob divides this by 2 since it is a perfect power of 2. Since the number has become equal to 1, hence Bob wins the game.'
