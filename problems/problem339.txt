b"Problem\nConsider an array AAA of size NNN which only contains 1s1s1s and 0s0s0s. Let's define 'Group' as the subarray containing only 0s or only 1s. You are also given two values xxx and yyy. Your task is to flip the values (from 000 to 111 or from 111 to 000) in the array such that length of every 'Group' is between xxx and yyy (inclusive). But thats not it :p. You are also given another array BBB of size NNN which consists of the cost of flipping the respective values of array A. Formally, for each position iii from 111 to NNN ,the cost of flipping the value of AiAiAi is BiBiBi. You need to find the minimum cost such that the resultant array A\xe2\x80\xb2A'A\xe2\x80\xb2 satisfy the given condition. \nNote: It is possible that answer does not exist. In that case print -1.\nInput\nFirst line contains TTT denoting number of test cases.Next line consists of NNN denoting the size of the arrays. Next line contains xxx and yyy as described in the problem.Following line consists of NNN space separated integers of array AAA where elements can be 000 or 111. Next line consists of NNN space separated integers of array BBB, cost of flipping the values at ithithith position.\nOutput\nIf answer exists, print overall minimum cost else print -1 (in new line).\nConstraints\n\n111 <= TTT \\lt= 707070\n111 <= NNN \\lt= 100010001000\n111 <= xxx <= yyy \\lt= NNN\nAiAiAi can be 000 or 111\n000 <= BiBiBi \\lt= 100010001000\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (15 points):\n\n111 <= NNN \\lt= 151515\nSubtask #2 (85 points):\n\n111 <= NNN \\lt= 100010001000\nExample\nInput:\n1\n5\n2 3\n0 1 0 1 0\n10 5 11 4 1\nOutput:\n6\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. The resultant array is [0,0,0,1,1] and the overall minimum cost is 6."
