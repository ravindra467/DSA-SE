b"Problem\nNaruto will be given certain missions for which he will have to visit a particular village(target village). Obviously he will take the shortest path from his village (Village 111). On his way to the target village, all the villages he visits (except his home village), he needs to pay some tax, even for the target village. Naruto knows the tax, AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b for each village. However, the tax for any village might change suddenly and this has confused Naruto. Thus he is seeking your help.\nEach village has a number between 111 to NNN (inclusive). They are connected by paths. The whole network of the village is in the form of a tree with its root being village 111 which is Naruto's home.\nYou will be given QQQ queries,  queries are of 222 type-\n\n111 xxx - find the total tax to be paid to visit village xxx\n222 xxx uuu - increase the tax of village x by an amount uuu\n\nNote that Naruto might get a mission in his own village as well. In that case, it will be a taxless mission(tax=0).\nHelp Naruto to calculate tax for each of his missions.\nInput:\n\nFirst Line contains NNN & QQQ, the number of villages and number of queries.\nNext N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contain two space-separated integers aaa and bbb denoting that villages aaa and bbb are connected by a path.\nNext line contains N integers A1,A2,A3,....,ANA_1,A_2,A_3,....,A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,A3\xe2\x80\x8b,....,AN\xe2\x80\x8b where AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b represents tax to visit the ithi^{th}ith village.\nNext QQQ lines follow, where each line can be of two types\nFirst type is  111 xxx\nSecond type is 222 xxx uuu\n\nOutput:\nFor each query of type 1,  print the total tax to be paid by naruto on his way to that village taking the shortest route.\nConstraints\n\n10\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410510 \\leq N \\leq 10^510\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n10\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa410510 \\leq Q \\leq 10^510\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b,x\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq a,b,x \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4a,b,x\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\leq u \\leq 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4u\xe2\x89\xa4103\n\nSample Input:\n 4 3\r\n 1 2\r\n 2 3\r\n 3 4\r\n 7 3 5 4\r\n 1 4\r\n 2 3 5\r\n 1 4\n\nSample Output:\n 12\r\n 17\n\nEXPLANATION:\nIn the first query, tax is paid at village 2,32,32,3 and 444. Thus ans is 3+5+43+5+43+5+4. In second query, tax of village 222 increases to 101010. Thus in Query 333 the answer is 3+10+43+10+43+10+4."
