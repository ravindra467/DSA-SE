b'Problem\nGroup Photo\nThe students of KJSCE First Year were called in for a group photo. The photographer insisted that the students follow the following arrangement:\n\nEvery row except the last row contains exactly P students.\nThe last row can fit anywhere between P and P+K students, both inclusive.\nAll students must have height strictly lesser than all students standing in all the rows behind them. i.e Every student in the ith row must have a height strictly lesser than all students in (i+1)th row, (i+2)th row and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis a very basic illustration of the desired arrangement. The number of circles (representing students) is N\nAditya felt that the given arrangement may not always be possible. Given N(the number of students), P, K and the heights of all the students Hi, find out whether the photographer\'s arrangement is possible or not. Print "YES" if it is, "NO" if it not. (Both without the quotes)\nNote: If the arrangement consists of only one row, consider it as the last row and not the front ( i.e it should obey the conditions for last row).\nConstraints:\n1<=T<=100\n1<=N<=105\n1<=P<=105\n1<=K<=P\n100<=Hi<=200\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains exactly one interger T, the number of testcases\nThe first line of each testcase contains 3 space separated integers N, P and K.\nThe second line of each testcase contains N space separated integers, the heights of all students.\n\nOutput:\n\nFor each tescase, output one word, either "YES" or "NO", based on the possibility of the arrangement.\n\nExample:\nInput:\n2\n4 2 1\n150 140 140 180\n3 4 1\n120 150 145\n\nOutput:\nYES\nNO\n'
