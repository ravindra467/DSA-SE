b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef recently graduated Computer Science in university, so he was looking for a job. He applied for several job offers, but he eventually settled for a software engineering job at ShareChat. Chef was very enthusiastic about his new job and the first mission assigned to him was to implement a message encoding feature to ensure the chat is private and secure.\nChef has a message, which is a string SSS with length NNN containing only lowercase English letters. It should be encoded in two steps as follows:\n\nSwap the first and second character of the string SSS, then swap the 3rd and 4th character, then the 5th and 6th character and so on. If the length of SSS is odd, the last character should not be swapped with any other.\nReplace each occurrence of the letter \'a\' in the message obtained after the first step by the letter \'z\', each occurrence of \'b\' by \'y\', each occurrence of \'c\' by \'x\', etc, and each occurrence of \'z\' in the message obtained after the first step by \'a\'.\n\nThe string produced in the second step is the encoded message. Help Chef and find this message.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nThe second line contains the message string SSS.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one string \xe2\x80\x94 the encoded message.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le T \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le N \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3=N|S| = N\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3=N\nSSS contains only lowercase English letters\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n9\nsharechat\n4\nchefshizxvzsg\nsxuv\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: The original message is "sharechat". In the first step, we swap four pairs of letters (note that the last letter is not swapped), so it becomes "hsraceaht". In the second step, we replace the first letter (\'h\') by \'s\', the second letter (\'s\') by \'h\', and so on, so the resulting encoded message is "shizxvzsg".'
