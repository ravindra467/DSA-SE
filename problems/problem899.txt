b"Problem\nAnjali loves food and she loves to cook. With time, she has mastered the art of transforming a cooked dish into another one. A dish can be represented as a string, where the ingredients are denoted by upper case English alphabets, and the order of ingredients does matter. She has already cooked a dish AAA which she wants to transform to another dish BBB. There are three types operations which she can perform any number of times (including 000) and in any order on dish AAA to make dish BBB:\n\nDrop an ingredient free of cost.\nAdd an ingredient at the end with unit cost.\nSwap a pair of ingredients free of cost.\n\nCan you help her determine the minimum possible cost to make dish BBB from her dish AAA?\nInput:\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains the string AAA.\nThe second line contains the string BBB.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case print a single line containing an integer denoting the minimum possible cost to cook dish BBB from dish AAA.\nConstraints:\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq T \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3A\xe2\x88\xa3,\xe2\x88\xa3B\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq |A|, |B| \\leq 10^{5}1\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3A\xe2\x88\xa3,\xe2\x88\xa3B\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4105\n(\xe2\x88\xa3A\xe2\x88\xa3|A|\xe2\x88\xa3A\xe2\x88\xa3 denotes the length of string AAA)\nBoth the strings contain only upper case English alphabets\n\nSubtasks:\n\n10 points: 1\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3A\xe2\x88\xa3,\xe2\x88\xa3B\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\leq |A|, |B| \\leq 10^{3}1\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3A\xe2\x88\xa3,\xe2\x88\xa3B\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4103\n90 points: original constraints\n\nSample Input:\n1\r\nABC\r\nABCCD\n\nSample Output:\n2\n\nExplanation:\n\nExample Case 1: She can first add the ingredient 'C' at the end with unit cost, and then she can add the ingredient 'D' at the end with unit cost. Since the ordering of ingredients of AAA matches with that of BBB after these two operations, there is no need to perform any other operation. Hence, 222 is the minimum possible cost.\n"
