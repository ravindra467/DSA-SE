b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nThere are NNN candies (numbered 111 through NNN) on a circular table. For each valid iii, candies iii and i+1i+1i+1 are adjacent; candies 111 and NNN are also adjacent. You want to eat all these candies.\nInitially, your happiness level is 000. For each valid iii, when you eat the iii-th candy, the happiness level increases by aia_iai\xe2\x80\x8b. Note that aia_iai\xe2\x80\x8b may be negative and your happiness level may also become negative.\nFirst, you should eat the candy 111. After that, while there is at least one uneaten candy, you may eat any candy that is adjacent to at least one of the candies eaten so far.\nYour goal is to maximise the smallest value of your happiness during this process.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aNa_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_Na1\xe2\x80\x8b,a2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,aN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the maximum possible minimum happiness value during the process.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4200,0001 \\le T \\le 200,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4200,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4200,0001 \\le N \\le 200,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4200,000\n\xe2\x88\xa3ai\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4109|a_i| \\le 10^9\xe2\x88\xa3ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid iii\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 200,000200,000200,000\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): N\xe2\x89\xa420N \\le 20N\xe2\x89\xa420\nSubtask #2 (10 points): N\xe2\x89\xa4300N \\le 300N\xe2\x89\xa4300\nSubtask #3 (80 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n3\n1 2 3\n3\n-10 -20 30\n3\n-1 0 01\n-10\n-1'
