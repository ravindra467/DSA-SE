b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef is trying to open the oven in his kitchen to cook some cookies. However, the oven is special \xe2\x80\x95 you need a password to open it.\nLet\'s define a function f(x)f(x)f(x) for a positive integer xxx as follows:\n\nConsider the decimal representation of xxx (without leading zeros). Split it into the minimum number of contiguous subsequences of digits such that in each subsequence, all digits are identical.\nFor each subsequence, look at its position in the original decimal representation of xxx. Let\'s say that the most significant digit it contained was the eee-th digit, where e=0e=0e=0 corresponds to the least significant digit of xxx. For example, 388,822,442388,822,442388,822,442 can be split into subsequences "3", "888", "22", "44", "2", where e=7e=7e=7 for the sequence "888" and e=4e=4e=4 for the sequence "22".\nThe value of a subsequence which contains a digit ddd repeated one or more times is d\xe2\x8b\x8510ed \\cdot 10^ed\xe2\x8b\x8510e.\nf(x)f(x)f(x) is the sum of values of these subsequences. For example, f(388,822,442)=3\xe2\x8b\x85108+8\xe2\x8b\x85107+2\xe2\x8b\x85104+4\xe2\x8b\x85102+2\xe2\x8b\x85100f(388,822,442) = 3 \\cdot 10^8 + 8 \\cdot 10^7 + 2 \\cdot 10^4 + 4 \\cdot 10^2 + 2 \\cdot 10^0f(388,822,442)=3\xe2\x8b\x85108+8\xe2\x8b\x85107+2\xe2\x8b\x85104+4\xe2\x8b\x85102+2\xe2\x8b\x85100.\n\nThe oven has a screen which displays two long integers LLL and RRR (with NLN_LNL\xe2\x80\x8b and NRN_RNR\xe2\x80\x8b digits respectively, without leading zeros). The password is the sum of f(x)f(x)f(x) for each xxx between LLL and RRR inclusive.\nChef does not have a lot of time, so he asks for your help. Please find the password for the oven so that he can start cooking as fast as possible. Since this number could be very large, compute it modulo 109+710^9 + 7109+7.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NLN_LNL\xe2\x80\x8b and LLL.\nThe second line contains two space-separated integers NRN_RNR\xe2\x80\x8b and RRR.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the password.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\le T \\le 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4NL,NR\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le N_L, N_R \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4NL\xe2\x80\x8b,NR\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R<10100,0001 \\le L \\le R \\lt 10^{100,000}1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R<10100,000\nLLL and RRR do not contain leading zeros\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points):\n\nR\xe2\x88\x92L\xe2\x89\xa4105R - L \\le 10^5R\xe2\x88\x92L\xe2\x89\xa4105\nR<1018R \\lt 10^{18}R<1018\n\nSubtask #2 (20 points): R<1018R \\lt 10^{18}R<1018\nSubtask #3 (70 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n1 9\n2 97\n1 8\n2 12\n1 1\n1 84681\n49\n36\nExplanation:\nExample case 2: f(8)=8,f(9)=9,f(10)=10,f(11)=10,f(12)=12f(8) = 8, f(9) = 9, f(10) = 10, f(11) = 10, f(12) = 12f(8)=8,f(9)=9,f(10)=10,f(11)=10,f(12)=12'
