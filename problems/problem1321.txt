b'Problem\nA tree is an undirected connected graph without any cycles. You are given a tree with N nodes and a parameter K. Each node in the node has a positive weight W[]. The tree needs to be partitioned into at most K subtrees by removing at most K-1 edges such that the maximum weight of the resulting subtrees is as small as possible. Find that smallest value of the maximum subtree weight that can be obtained by removing at most K-1 edges.\nInput\nFirst Line contains N, the number of nodes in the tree and K, the number of subtrees.\nNext line contains N integers, denoting weights of the nodes. The ith integer denotes W[i] \nNext, there are N-1 lines with 2 integers each, denoting the edges in the tree. \n\nOutput\nOutput a single integer, the answer. \nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 20000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 W[i] \xe2\x89\xa4 10^9\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput1:\n3 2\n5 10 2\n1 2 \n2 3\nInput2:\n3 3\n5 10 2\n1 2\n1 3\nOutput1:\n12\nOutput2:\n10\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nExample case 1. We can break the edge between 1 and 2\nExample case 2. We can break both the edges'
