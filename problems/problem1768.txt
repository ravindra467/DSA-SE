b"Problem\nChef is playing cards with his friend Devu. The cards are based on a fantasy series, and each card represents a character from the series. Each card has a positive number on it, which is the power of the character represented. There are a total of 2N cards, which are shuffled and divided between Chef and Devu so that they have N cards each.\nThe game proceeds as follows, please read carefully. Each player arranges their cards in a specific order of their choosing. Next, each player takes one card from the top of their arranged deck, and the cards are battled against each other. If the cards have the same power, no one wins, otherwise the player with the card of higher power wins. The 2 cards are now removed from the game. For the next round, each player again picks a card from the top of his deck and repeats the process. A card cannot be drawn from anywhere but the top, thus the order determined at the start must be followed throughout the game. This is done until all N rounds are over. At the end of the game, the player who won most battles is declared the winner.\nNow, Chef is clever. He seats himself and Devu in such a manner that he is able to observe Devu arranging his cards and knows the order in which they are arranged. Devu is honest and does not know Chef's arrangement of cards. Can you help Chef arrange his own cards so as to maximize the number of battles he will win?\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains N, the number of cards each player has.\nThe second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers denoting the powers of Chef's cards.\nThe third line of each test case contains N space-separated integers denoting the powers of Devu's cards, arranged in the order which Devu has decided.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing an integer which is the maximum number of battles Chef can win after strategically arranging his own cards.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Power of any card \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 1 1 6 6\n6\n12 8 4 6 2 10\n4 4 4 14 12 6\nOutput:\n3\n4\n\nExplanation\nIn test case 1, one possible arrangement for Chef that gives highest wins is [5, 4, 3, 2, 1].\nIn test case 2, one possible arrangement for Chef that gives highest wins is [12, 10, 6, 4, 2, 8]."
