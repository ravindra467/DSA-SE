b'Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef likes to play with trees a lot. This time, he has a rooted tree T consisting of N nodes labelled uniquely with the integers from {1, \xe2\x80\xa6 N}. The node labelled 1 is the root of the tree. Each node in the given tree T stores a non-negative integer, initially all of which are zeros. Chef wants to perform 2 types of operations over the tree accurately and efficiently.\n\nU X K: Update the subtree rooted at node X such that the the root X will have FK (the Kth Fibonacci number) added to it, all its children will have Fk+1 (the (K+1)th Fibonacci number) added to them, and so on. More formally, any node in the subtree rooted at X will have (K+D)th fibonacci number added to them, where D is the distance of the node from X.\nQ X: Report the value stored at the node X.\n\nSince the answer to each query can be very large, output it modulo 109 + 7.\nNOTE:\nFK denotes the Kth Fibonacci number, and the series is generated as follows:\n\nFK = 1, if K \xe2\x89\xa4 2 .\nFK = FK-1 + FK-2, otherwise.\n\n\nTo know more about Fibonacci numbers, click here.\n\nInput:\nFirst line of input contains two integer N and M denoting the number of nodes in the tree T, and the number of queries to be processed, respectively. Next N-1 lines of input contain an integer each, where the integer in the ith line denotes the parent of the (i+1)th node. Each of the next M lines contains one of the 2 types of queries mentioned above.\nOutput:\nFor each operation of type Q, output the required answer modulo 109 + 7.\nConstraints:\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, M, K \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 U, V, X \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n\nExample\nInput\n5 10\n1\n1\n3\n3\nQ 3\nU 1 2\nQ 2\nQ 3\nQ 4\nQ 5\nU 3 1\nQ 3\nQ 4\nQ 5\nOutput\n0\n2\n2\n3\n3\n3\n4\n4\n\nExplanation\n\n\n'
