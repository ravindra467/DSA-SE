b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef and Chefu are at a magical candy store playing a game with the following rules:\n\nThere are two candy counters; each of them stores an infinite number of candies. At any time, only one of the counters is open and the other is closed.\nExactly one player is present at each of the counters. Initially, Chef is at the open counter and Chefu is at the closed counter.\nThere is a sequence of NNN distinct integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b. The game consists of RRR turns; in the iii-th turn, the open counter offers only C=A(i\xe2\x88\x921)%N+1C = A_{ (i-1) \\% N + 1}C=A(i\xe2\x88\x921)%N+1\xe2\x80\x8b candies to the player present at this counter. This player should choose a positive number of candies MMM to accept, where 1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4C1 \\le M \\le C1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4C.\nIf this player accepts an odd number of candies, the players have to swap their positions (each player goes to the other counter).\nAfter each NNN turns, the counter which was currently open is closed and the counter which was currently closed is opened.\nThe primary goal of each player is to maximise his own number of candies after RRR turns. As a second priority, each player wants to minimise the number of candies his opponent has after RRR turns.\n\nYou should process QQQ queries. In each query, you are given RRR and you should find the number of candies Chef has after RRR turns, assuming that both players play the game optimally. Since this number could be very large, compute it modulo 109+710^9 + 7109+7.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b.\nThe third line contains a single integer QQQ.\nEach of the next QQQ lines contains a single integer RRR describing a query.\n\nOutput\nFor each query, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the maximum number of candies Chef can get, modulo 109+710^9+7109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4251 \\le T \\le 251\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa425\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le N \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\le A_i \\le 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid iii\nA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b are pairwise distinct\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le Q \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa410121 \\le R \\le 10^{12}1\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa41012\nthe sum of N+QN + QN+Q over all test cases does not exceed 10610^6106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (15 points):\n\nN\xe2\x89\xa410N \\le 10N\xe2\x89\xa410\nQ\xe2\x89\xa435Q \\le 35Q\xe2\x89\xa435\nR\xe2\x89\xa435R \\le 35R\xe2\x89\xa435\n\nSubtask #2 (85 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n4\n4 10 2 1\n2\n4\n517\n21\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: In the 111-st, 222-nd and 333-rd turn, Chef takes 444, 101010 and 222 candies (161616 in total) respectively. In the 444-th turn, Chef takes 111 candy (171717 in total; this is the answer to the first query), which is odd and hence he has to go to the counter which is closed. However, since N=4N = 4N=4 turns are just completed, the counter which was currently open closes and the other one (where Chef went) opens. In the 555-th round, Chef can take 444 candies, so he has 212121 candies.'
