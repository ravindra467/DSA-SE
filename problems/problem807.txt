b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Vietnamese,\nBengali, Mandarin Chinese, and Russian as well.\nYou are given a tree with nnn vertices (numbered 1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,n1, 2, \\dots, n1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,n) and an integer kkk.\nA subtree is defined as a connected subgraph of the tree. That is, a subtree is another tree that can be obtained by removing some (possibly none) vertices and all edges incident to those vertices from TTT.\nA subset SSS of vertices is called good if every subtree containing all the nodes in SSS has at least kkk nodes.\nFind the size of the smallest good subset.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer TTT, the number of test cases. The descriptions of test cases follow.\nThe first line of each testcase contains two integers, nnn and kkk.\nThe next n\xe2\x88\x921n-1n\xe2\x88\x921 lines each contains two integers uuu, vvv, denoting an edge between vertices uuu and vvv of the tree.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case print in a single line, the minimum size of a good subset.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41051\\leq n\\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n1 \\leq k \\leq n1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n1 \\leq u, v \\leq n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4n\nThe given edges for each test case form a tree.\nThe sum of nnn over all test cases is at most 10610^6106.\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\leq n \\leq 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4103\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\nSample Input\n2\r\n7 5\r\n1 2\r\n2 3\r\n3 4\r\n3 5\r\n5 6\r\n3 7\r\n6 4\r\n1 2\r\n1 3\r\n1 4\r\n1 5\r\n1 6\n\nSample Output\n2\r\n3\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 111:\r\nConsider the set S={1,6}S = \\{1, 6\\}S={1,6}.\nThe smallest subtree that contains both of the vertices in SSS is the path between them (1\xe2\x86\x922\xe2\x86\x923\xe2\x86\x925\xe2\x86\x9261 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 5 \\to 61\xe2\x86\x922\xe2\x86\x923\xe2\x86\x925\xe2\x86\x926) which contains 555 vertices. Hence for k=5k = 5k=5, the answer is 222.\nTest Case 222:\r\nConsider the set S={2,3,4}S = \\{2, 3, 4\\}S={2,3,4}.\nThe smallest subtree that contains these three vertices includes 444 nodes {1,2,3,4}\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}{1,2,3,4}.'
