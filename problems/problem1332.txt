b'Problem\n\xc2\xa0\n\nChef has a non-decreasing array A of N elements. Since Chef was getting bored in his holidays, he was wondering how many subarrays exist in the array, such that the arithmetic mean (avergae) of the subarray is less than the integer K. As the number of such subarrays can be a lot, Chef is asking for your help to exhaust his curiosity. \n\nA subarray is a contiguous part of an array. A single element is also considered a subarray. For example, [3], [4] and [3, 4, 5] are some of the subarrays of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Two subarrays are different if their start or/and end indices are different. \n\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers N and K. The second line contains N space-separated integers in non-decreasing order A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the array.\nOutput\nOutput one integer, the number of subarrays who has mean strictly less than K. Note that this number exceed the maximum of what a C++ integer can hold. \nSubtasks\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 109 for all subtasks\nSubtask 1(10 points): All numbers in the array are the same\nSubtask 2(30 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 103, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 103\nSubtask 3(60 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 106, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n \nExample\nInput:\n5 4\n2 2 3 5 6 \nOutput:\n9\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\n The subarrays are: [2], [2], [3], [2, 2], [2, 3], [2, 2, 3], [2, 3, 5], [2, 2, 3, 5], [2, 2, 3, 5, 6]  '
