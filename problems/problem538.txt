b'Problem\nThe city of Quensland has NNN city and they are connected by N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 roads having no cycles. There always exists a unique path between any two cities.Each road is bidirectional having length of 1 and connects two different cities. A new pizza service has arrived in Quensland where requests are served as queries , please note that the toppings of the pizza differentiate the pizzas with their colors.\nIf a query is given as ppp ddd ccc  , it is described as serving pizzas having toppings of color  changed to ccc to all the\r\ncities within the distance d from city ppp, including ppp itself.\nMike the owner of the pizza service resides in city 1, thereby, rooting the whole tree at City1City 1City1. Now , he wants to know the count of all distinct colors of the toppings after all the requests are served at the end of day for each city .\r\n0 is also considered as a color.\nNOTE:NOTE :NOTE: Given ddd may exceed the total distance when you start travelling from a city , in that case consider all the cities that can be covered by travelling distance d from the given tree.\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains an integer NNN denoting the number of cities.\nThe next N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contain two space separated integers aia_{i}ai\xe2\x80\x8b and bib_{i}bi\xe2\x80\x8b denoting that there is a road -connecting city aia_{i}ai\xe2\x80\x8b and bib_{i}bi\xe2\x80\x8b.\nThe next line contains an integer QQQ denoting the number of queries.\nThe next QQQ lines contain three space separated integers pip_{i}pi\xe2\x80\x8b,did_{i}di\xe2\x80\x8b and cic_{i}ci\xe2\x80\x8b denoting that the pizza service pip_{i}pi\xe2\x80\x8b along with the pizza service within distance did_{i}di\xe2\x80\x8b should have pizza toppings of color changed to cic_{i}ci\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput:\nPrint the answer in NNN space separated integers , the ithithith integer denoting the number of distinct colors of all toppings present in the subtree rooted at the ithithith city after all QQQ operations are performed.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa4100000 1 \\leq N,Q \\leq 1000001\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa4100000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai,bi,pi\xe2\x89\xa4N1\\leq a_{i},b_{i},p_{i} \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x80\x8b,bi\xe2\x80\x8b,pi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4N\nai\xe2\x89\xa0bia_{i} \\neq b_{i}ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xee\x80\xa0=bi\xe2\x80\x8b\n0\xe2\x89\xa4di\xe2\x89\xa4200 \\leq d_{i} \\leq 200\xe2\x89\xa4di\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa420\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa41000001 \\leq c_{i} \\leq 1000001\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4100000\n\nSUBTASKS:\n\n10 points:\r\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq N,Q \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa41000\n90 points:\r\nOriginal constraints\n\nNOTENOTENOTE - There are no self loops or multiple edges in the tree and initially all the pizza services have pizzas of topping coloured as 0.\nSample Input:\n7\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n4 5\n5 6\n5 7\n2\n6 1 1\n1 2 2\nSample Output:\n3 1 1 3 3 1 1\nEXPLANATION:\nInititally all houses are uncolored , sol let the color array be [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\r\nAfter query 1 -\r\nThe color array will be [0,0,0,0,1,1,0]\r\nAfter query 2 -\r\nThe color array wil be [2,2,2,2,2,1,0]\nNow for each ith node , the number of distinct colors in all the nodes having ith node as the root -\r\n[3,1,1,3,3,1,1]'
