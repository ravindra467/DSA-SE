b"Problem\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Bengali as well.\nA programming competition will be held in Chef's city which only accepts teams of size 222. At least one person in a team should know a programming language and at least one person should know about the English language. It is possible that one person in a team knows both programming and the English language. Then the qualification of the other teammate is not important i.e. he may or may not know programming and English. Now Chef has NNN students and wants to send maximum number of teams to the competition.\nYou are given an integer NNN and two binary strings SSS and TTT of length NNN. Si=S_i = Si\xe2\x80\x8b= '1' denotes that the ithi^{th}ith student knows a programming language, and Si=S_i = Si\xe2\x80\x8b= '0' denotes otherwise; similarly, Ti=T_i =Ti\xe2\x80\x8b= '1' denotes that the ithi^{th}ith student knows English language, and Ti=T_i = Ti\xe2\x80\x8b= '0' denotes otherwise. Determine the maximum number of teams Chef can form.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer QQQ denoting the number of test cases. The description of QQQ test cases follows.\nEach test case contains 333 lines of input.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer NNN.\nThe second line of each test case contains a string SSS.\nThe last line of each test case contains a string TTT.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the maximum number of teams that Chef can form.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq Q \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq N \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\nSSS and TTT contains only characters '0' and '1'\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4\n3\n101\n001\n4\n1010\n0110\n3\n000\n110\n2\n10\n11\n1\n2\n0\n1\n\nExplanation:\nTest case 111: The third student can team up with any other students as he knows both programming and English.\nTest case 222: The first two students make a team and the last two students make another team.\nTest case 333: No student knows how to program, hence there is no way to make a team."
