b"Problem\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\n\nYou are a citizen of Arrayland. Your President (Mr. P) has given you a mundane problem:\n\n\nYou're given an array a with size N (1-based indexing). You are allowed to perform an arbitrary number (including zero) of operations of the following type: choose an integer i (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 N) and swap ai with aN-i+1.\n\n\nYour goal is to make the array a great. An array is great if it satisfies one of the following conditions:\n\na1 > a2 < a3 > a4 < ... aN\na1 < a2 > a3 < a4 > ... aN\n\n\nCompute the minimum number of operations necessary to make the array a great or determine that it's impossible to make it great.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of the array a.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., aN.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum number of operations required to make the array great, or -1 if it's impossible.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 5\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 ai \xe2\x89\xa4 109 for each valid i\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n6\n1 2 3 4 5 61\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: The given array is NOT great. If you swap the second and the fifth element, then the array becomes great."
