b'Problem\n\nYou are given N sticks, where the length of each stick is a positive integer. A cut operation is performed on the sticks such that all of them are reduced by the length of the smallest stick.\nGiven the length of N sticks, print the number of sticks that are left before each subsequent cut operations.\nNote: For each cut operation, you have to recalculate the length of smallest sticks (excluding zero-length sticks).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer N. \nThe next line contains N integers separated by space, where each integer represents the length of the ith stick.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each operation, print the number of sticks that are cut, on separate lines.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 <= N <= 50000\n1 <= stick length <= 1000000\n\nExample\nInput:\n6\n5 4 4 2 2 8\nOutput:\n6\n4\n2\n1\n\nExplanation\nsticks-length        length-of-cut   sticks-cut\n5 4 4 2 2 8             2               6\n3 2 2 _ _ 6             2               4\n1 _ _ _ _ 4             1               2\n_ _ _ _ _ 3             3               1\n_ _ _ _ _ _           DONE            DONE\n'
