b"Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nSerega is an avid traveller. He has already visited numerous exotic places, and now wants to embark on a journey to Treeland. There are N cities in Treeland that Serega wants to visit. Also, roads have been laid between some N-1 pairs of cities in Treeland. Roads are bidirectional, and there exists a unique path between any two Treeland cities.\n\nEach of Treeland's roads has its own class, wich is specified using a single digit. Serega's journey is a path between some cities, i.e. he never visits one city more than once. But Serega wants to select a path such that the sequence of classes on the path is a palindrome. Of course, Serega wants to visit as many cities as possible. Please help Him.\n\nInput\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each case contains a single integer N. The next N-1 lines contain the roads. Each line contains three integers v, u and c, meaning that there is a road of class c between the vth and uth (assuming 1-indexing) cities of Treeland.\nOutput\nFor each test case, you should output the maximum number of cities that Serega can visit.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 3*105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\nSum of N over all test cases in a single file will not be greater then 3*105\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 c \xe2\x89\xa4 9\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 u, v \xe2\x89\xa4 N\nThe roads form a tree.\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 (15 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 102 \nSubtask #2: (85 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105 \n\n \nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n8\n1 2 1\n1 3 0\n3 4 1\n4 5 2\n1 6 0\n6 7 1\n7 8 27\nExplanation:\nSequence of classes on the path between the cities 5 and 8 is 210012."
