b'Problem\nThe next jump takes you to a bizarre yet familiar group of islands. You walk up to Prof Paradox and you get to know about a recent reverse-engineering debacle that brought back the Dinosaurs. These Dinosaurs escaped from their captivity and now are set to destroy the group of islands.\nEach island has a defense power of AiAiAi. Some of these islands are connected with a bridge. The total power of the connected islands is the sum of each of their individual defense powers.\r\nTo battle the dinosaurs, you need all the defense that you can get. But, the mad scientist refuses to link all the connected islands, owing to the years of arch enmity between these groups and simply because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to.\nWith every peace treaty between two groups, the total defense power is the product of their individual defense powers.\nCan you convince the islanders to join hands against the dinosaurs by showing them the total power they can hold?\nSince the results can be large, output result modulo 1000000007 (109+710^9 + 7109+7).\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nFirst line of each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers N,MN, MN,M where NNN\r\ndenotes the number of islands and M denotes the number of bridges.\nNext line contains NNN spaced integers denoting the defense value of each island.\nThen MMM lines follow, each containing, two integers uuu and vvv indicating that there is a\r\nbridge between island uuu and island vvv.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line the total power modulo 1000000007.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq T \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000002 \\leq N \\leq 1000002\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa450000001 \\leq M \\leq 50000001\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa45000000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq Ai \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSubtasks\n\n100 points :Original Constraints\n\nSample Input:\n1\r\n3 2\r\n2 3 9 \r\n1 2\r\n3 1\n\nSample Output:\n14\n\nEXPLANATION:\nAll the Islands are connected, Hence the defense power value is the sum of all powers,\ni.e; 222+333+999=141414'
