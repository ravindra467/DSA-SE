b'Problem\nYogesh has built a new hospital, with N(2<= N <= 100,000) beds. The beds are located along a straight line at positions x1,...,xN (0 <= xi <= 1,000,000,000).\nTheir are C(2<= C <=N) number of COVID infected persons. To prevent the further infections, you have to assign the beds to infected persons in such a way that the minimum distance between any two of them is as large as possible.\nWhat is the largest minimum distance?\nConstraints\n(2 <= N <= 100,000)\n(0 <= xi <= 1,000,000,000)\n(2 <= C <= N)   ### Input\nt \xe2\x80\x93 the number of test cases, then t test cases follows.\n\nLine 1: Two space-separated integers: N and C\nLine 2: N space seperated integers representing the bed locations i.e xi\n\nOutput\nFor each test case output one integer: the largest minimum distance.## Sample Testcase 1:\nInput\n1\n5 3\n1 2 8 4 9  ### Output:\n3'
