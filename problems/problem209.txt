b"Problem\nChef's college is conducting online exams. Chef has a test tomorrow and he being irresponsible failed to prepare for it on time (just as always). However, fortunately, he now realises the gravity of the situation and decides to prepare as much as possible in the time remaining and try to score maximum marks possible using his analytical skills.\nThere are NNN chapters and only KKK minutes are left before the exam. Chapter iii will be worth MiM_iMi\xe2\x80\x8b marks in the exam, and shall take TiT_iTi\xe2\x80\x8b minutes to study. Chef can study the chapters in any order but needs to study them completely and at most once. He knows that he will forget the first chapter that he will prepare (due to lack of sleep) and won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to score any marks in it. Find the maximum marks that Chef can score in the exam.\nNote that he cannot re-study the chapter that he has forgotten.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nEach testcase contain N+1N + 1N+1 lines of input.\nFirst line will contain 222 space separated integers NNN and KKK, total number of chapters and total time left before the exam respectively.\nEach of the next NNN lines contain 222 space separated integers MiM_iMi\xe2\x80\x8b and TiT_iTi\xe2\x80\x8b, weightage and time for the ithi^{th}ith chapter respectively.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line answer to the problem.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq T \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\leq N \\leq 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\leq K \\leq 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Mi\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq M_i \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Mi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ti\xe2\x89\xa4K1 \\leq T_i \\leq K1\xe2\x89\xa4Ti\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4K\nSum of N\xe2\x88\x97KN * KN\xe2\x88\x97K over all tests is atmost 10710^7107\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n2 2\n1 1\n2 1\n3 3\n1 1\n2 2\n3 3\n5 6\n5 1\n4 2\n3 3\n2 4\n1 52\n2\n9\nExplanation:\nTestCase 1: Optimal solution is to study first chapter first followed by second chapter.

So total marks ensured =1+2\xe2\x88\x921=2= 1 + 2 - 1 = 2=1+2\xe2\x88\x921=2\nTestCase 3: Optimal solution is to study third chapter first followed by second and first chapter. So total marks ensured =3+4+5\xe2\x88\x923=9= 3 + 4 + 5 - 3 = 9=3+4+5\xe2\x88\x923=9"
