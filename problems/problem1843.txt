b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef really admires Gordon Ramsay. Both of them have restaurant chains. While Chef's restaurant chain consists of NNN facilities (numbered 111 through NNN), Gordon Ramsay has only 333, and yet Gordon's restaurants are superior. Chef's marketing team has figured out how to take over the market. According to them, the problem is that the customers have too many restaurants to choose from and that Gordon's staff, by accident or by sheer marketing genius, has figured out the perfect distribution of restaurants. Therefore, Chef wants to close down N\xe2\x88\x923N-3N\xe2\x88\x923 restaurants as fast as possible and create a restaurant structure similar to Gordon Ramsay's. For that, he needs your help!\nWe know that Gordon Ramsay's restaurants are numbered 1,2,31, 2, 31,2,3, where restaurant 111 is the smallest and restaurant 333 is the largest. They are located on a line in the order p1,p2,p3p_1, p_2, p_3p1\xe2\x80\x8b,p2\xe2\x80\x8b,p3\xe2\x80\x8b, so the restaurants p1p_1p1\xe2\x80\x8b and p2p_2p2\xe2\x80\x8b are adjacent and the restaurants p2p_2p2\xe2\x80\x8b and p3p_3p3\xe2\x80\x8b are adjacent too.\nChef's restaurant system is a tree with NNN vertices, where each vertex is one of his precious restaurants. Just like with Gordon's restaurants, they are numbered in the order of increasing size. Chef wants to count the number of ordered triples of restaurants (a1,a2,a3)(a_1, a_2, a_3)(a1\xe2\x80\x8b,a2\xe2\x80\x8b,a3\xe2\x80\x8b) which he can keep open while satisfying the following rules:\n\nThe restaurants a1a_1a1\xe2\x80\x8b, a2a_2a2\xe2\x80\x8b and a3a_3a3\xe2\x80\x8b are located on a line, i.e. a2a_2a2\xe2\x80\x8b is on the shortest path between a1a_1a1\xe2\x80\x8b and a3a_3a3\xe2\x80\x8b (rebuilding the existing structure would be too costly).\nFor each i,ji, ji,j (1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa431 \\le i, j \\le 31\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa43), if pi<pjp_i \\lt p_jpi\xe2\x80\x8b<pj\xe2\x80\x8b, then ai<aja_i \\lt a_jai\xe2\x80\x8b<aj\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nHelp Chef and calculate the number of these triples!\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases.
