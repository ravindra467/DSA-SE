b"Problem\nChef has Birthday on 4th April. Of course! chef's date of Birth has such a lot of properties, like:\n\nIt is also the smallest Smith number;\nThe smallest non-cyclic group has four elements;\n\n\nFour is the maximal degree of the equation that can be solved in radicals;\nThere is four-color theorem that states that any map can be colored in no more than four colors in such a way that no two adjacent regions are colored in the same color;\nLagrange's four-square theorem states that every positive integer can be written as the sum of at most four square numbers;\nFour is the maximum number of dimensions of a real division algebra;\nIn bases 6 and 12, 4 is a 1-automorphic number;\n\nAnd there are a lot more cool stuff about this number!\nso he decides to organize a party in which he is sending invitation to all his love ones  also he is careful about that no one should missed. To invite everyone in his\r\nBirthday party chef decides to make a list of member( numbered  111 to NNN ) A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AnA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AnA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,An.\nChef is very excited for his birthday party so he started to play with list.\nChef decided to take QQQ words( numbered  111 to PPP) and concatenate every single  word with all the members of list.\nNow chef knows that every string can convert and bring it to  first composite number.\nDuring this process of conversion chef decides to note the number of steps required to complete the task.\r\nChef decided to collect minimum and maximum number of steps for each each query.\nAll string is in small case letter.\nNote:\r\n-String length of A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AnA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AnA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,An is mmm.\r\n-String length of each query is nnn.\nComposite number: A whole number that can be made by multiplying other whole numbers.\nExample: 666 can be made by 2\xc3\x9732 \xc3\x97 32\xc3\x973 so is a composite number.\r\nBut 777 can not be made by multiplying other whole numbers (1\xc3\x9771\xc3\x9771\xc3\x977 would work, but we said to use other whole numbers) so is not a composite number, it is a prime number.\nAll whole numbers above 111 are either composite or prime.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer\xc2\xa0TTT\xc2\xa0denoting the number of test cases.\nThe description of\xc2\xa0TTT\xc2\xa0test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers\xc2\xa0NNN\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0PPP.\nThe second line contains\xc2\xa0NNN\xc2\xa0space-separated integers\xc2\xa0A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AnA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AnA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,An.\nPPP\xc2\xa0lines follows Each of these lines contains a single integer\xc2\xa0PPPPPP\xc2\xa0describing a query.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq T \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\leq N \\leq 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4m+n\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq m+n \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4m+n\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\nConcatenated string length goes 10510^5105 use modulo.\nOutput:\n\nFor each testcase TTT ,\n\n\nThe first line of each query contains n space seperated integers denoting number of steps to complete the task.\nThe second line of each query contains two space seperated integers denoting minimum and maximum number of steps.\n\nSample Input:\n2\r\n3 2\r\nbob john alex\r\nmary\r\njoy\r\n3 2\r\nsmith marsh alisa\r\nmandy\r\nalex\n\nSample Output:\n2 2 2 \r\n2 2\r\n1 2 2 \r\n1 2\r\n1 1 1 \r\n1 1\r\n1 1 1 \r\n1 1\n\nExplanation:\nExample case1:\nbob+mary=bobmary\r\nConcatenated string contains 7 letters and 7 i.e seven consists 5 letters and 5 consists 4 letter.\r\nSo during the process of conversion note the number of steps and print it.\nSame process for each query with other strings and print the output as mentoined above."
