b'Problem\nAjeyaa and Sriram are experimenting with a block simulator. The simulator generates a tower of NNN blocks. Each block in the tower has a unique value assigned to it. Both of them decide to rearrange the tower to make it look aesthetically more pleasing, with each having thought of a different way of doing it. Ajeyaa wants to arrange them such that the block values are in ascending order from top to bottom, while Sriram wants the block values in descending order from top to bottom.\nTo move a block, one can take it out and insert it between any 2 blocks. It can also be placed on top or inserted at the bottom. It takes 2 seconds to move one block from its original position to any other position. Unable to decide upon which method to use, both of them agree to use the method which uses the shortest time (that is, they will arrange the blocks either in ascending or descending order from top to bottom, depending on which method takes the shortest time). Find whose arrangement will be final and also find the minimum number of blocks which need to be moved.\nInput:\nThe first line contains one integer NNN, the number of blocks present.\nThe next line consists of NNN integers a[1],a[2],...,a[N]a[1],a[2],...,a[N]a[1],a[2],...,a[N], which represent the values present on the block from top to bottom.\nOutput:\nThe first line should be whose arrangement is used, i.e, AjeyaaAjeyaaAjeyaa or SriramSriramSriram. If both of the methods use the same time, then output the word "BothBothBoth" (without " ").\nThe next line should be the minimum number of blocks which need to be moved.\nConstraints:\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000001\\leq N \\leq1000001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4a[i]\xe2\x89\xa41091\\leq a[i] \\leq10^91\xe2\x89\xa4a[i]\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSample Input:\n7\n10 163 89 5 73 15 49\n\nSample Output:\nSriram\n3\n\nExplanation:\nTo obtain the arrangement 5  10  15  49  73  89  163 (ascending order from top to bottom) we need to move at least 4 blocks. First, from the initial arrangement, take 73 and insert it at the bottom. Take 89 and 163 and then do the same. Then insert 10 between 5 and 15.\nTo obtain 163  89  73  49  15  10  5 (descending order from top to bottom) however we only need to move 3 blocks. We just have to insert 15, 10 and 5 at the bottom.\nThus, Sriram\'s method (descending order from top to bottom) is faster.'
