b"Problem\nRead problems statements in mandarin chinese, russian and vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a multi-set S of N integers, and an integer K. You want to find the maximum value of minimal excluded non-negative integer (MEX) of the multi-set given that you are allowed to add at most any K integers to the multi-set. Find the maximum value of MEX that you can obtain. \nFew examples of finding MEX of a multi-set are as follows. MEX of multi-set {0} is 1, {1} is 0, {0, 1, 3} is 2, {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6} is 4.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of testcases.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space seperated integers N and K denoting the size of the multi-set and the maximum number of extra integers that you can add in the multi-set respectively.\nThe second line contains N space separated integers denoting the multi-set S: S1, S2 ,.... SN.\nOutput\nFor each testcase, output the answer in a single line. \nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 Si \xe2\x89\xa4 2 * 105\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 (15 points): K=0.\nSubtask #2 (85 points): Original Constraints.\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4\n3 0\n1 0 2\n3 1\n1 0 2\n4 3\n2 5 4 9\n2 0\n3 43\n4\n6\n0\nExplanation:\nExample case 1. As K = 0, so we can't add any element to the multi-set. Elements of the set are {1, 0, 2}. The MEX value of this set is 3.\nExample case 2. As K = 1, you are allowed to add at most 1 element to the multi-set. The multi-set are {1, 0, 2}. You can add element 3 to the multi-set, and it becomes {1, 0, 2, 3}. The MEX value of this multi-set is 4. There is no other way to have higher value of MEX of the set by adding at most one element to the multi-set."
