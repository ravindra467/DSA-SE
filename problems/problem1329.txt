b'Problem\nBheem is playing a game with Jaggu. Jaggu gives Bheem NNN strings and asked him to find the length of the shortest consecutive subarray, such that the characters of the string in the given subarray can be used to form the word given by Jaggu. He ask QQQ such questions, each question consist of a word. Bheem is not able to solve these queries as he gives his laddus to NITNITNIT topper. So he want you to calculate the minimum length of the subarray. If not possible print \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain NNN, number of strings Jaggu gives to Bheem.\nNext NNN lines contains a string SSS.\nThe next line contains QQQ, number of questions Jaggu asks.\nNext QQQ lines contains a string.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line, the minimum length of the subarray , such that the characters of the string in that range can be use to produce that word (ask by Jaggu).\nIf not any subarray possible , print \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100001 \\leq N  \\leq 100001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa41002 \\leq Q \\leq 1002\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4100\nSum of lenght of all the strings in input \xe2\x89\xa4\\leq\xe2\x89\xa4 100000100000100000\nSum of the lenth of all the strings in queries \xe2\x89\xa4\\leq\xe2\x89\xa4 100000100000100000\n\nSample Input:\n 3\r\n adew\r\n rdwq\r\n cgr\r\n 2\r\n aw\r\n rrc\n\nSample Output:\n 1\r\n 2\n\nEXPLANATION:\nFor first query:\r\nString 1(adew) can be use to form the word(aw) , So min length = 1\nFor second query:\r\nString 2-3 ( rdwg, cgr ) can be use to form the word ( rrc ) , So min length  = 2'
