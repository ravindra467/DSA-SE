b"Problem\nThe chef is owning a team and participating in an upcoming tournament.\nThere are NNN teams in the tournament apart from Chef\xe2\x80\x99s team and Chef\xe2\x80\x99s team plays against each of these NNN teams exactly once. The point system in the tournament is weird. If a team wins a match it will receive kkk points where kkk is the number of matches the team has played till then including the current one. Each team[i]team[i]team[i] has a power value P[i]P[i]P[i]  and the power of the chef\xe2\x80\x99s team is MMM. A team with greater power value will always beat a team with smaller power values. Since Chef is creating the schedule for the tournament. He wants to make his team get the maximum points possible. Find the maximum points that the chef's team gets mod 1000000007.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nThe first line of each testcase contains NNN and MMM the number of teams and power value of the Chef\xe2\x80\x99s team.\nThe second line of each testcase contains NNN space separated integers, namely P1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6PNP1, P2, \xe2\x80\xa6 PNP1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6PN.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single integer the maximum points Chef\xe2\x80\x99s team can get.\nConstraints :\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq T \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000001 \\leq N \\leq 1000001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq M \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq Pi \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nEach element in P is pairwise distinct and not equal to MMM\nSample Input:\n1\r\n3 5\r\n6 3 4\n\nSample Output:\n5\n\nEXPLANATION:\nChef\xe2\x80\x99s team can play in the same order as input and receive 555 points by beating two teams in second match and third match respectively."
