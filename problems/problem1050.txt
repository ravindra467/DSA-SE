b'Problem\nAccording to the new tax scheme, a new tax called the binary string tax was introduced! JJ has a binary string SSS of length NNN. According to the tax scheme, for every occurrence of 010101 in SSS, a tax of XXX rupees will be charged, while for every occurrence of 101010 in SSS, a tax of YYY rupees will be charged.\nFor example, if X=5X = 5X=5, Y=7Y = 7Y=7 and S=11010S = 11010S=11010, then SSS has 111 occurrence of 010101 and 222 occurrences of 101010, so the tax charged =5\xe2\x8b\x851+7\xe2\x8b\x852=19= 5 \\cdot 1 + 7 \\cdot 2 = 19=5\xe2\x8b\x851+7\xe2\x8b\x852=19\nJJ can rearrange the string SSS in any way he wants. He wants to minimize the amount of tax he has to pay. Can you help him do so?\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains a single integer TTT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers NNN, XXX and YYY - the length of the binary string SSS, the tax charged on an occurrence of 010101 and the tax charged on an occurrence of 101010.\nThe second line of each test case contains a binary string SSS of length NNN containing 000s and 111s only.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output the minimum amount of tax that JJ has to pay.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq T \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410002 \\leq N \\leq 10002\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X,Y\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le X, Y \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4X,Y\xe2\x89\xa4100\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n4 7 3\n1101\n5 3 4\n00000\n3\n0\n\nExplanation:\nTest Case 1: JJ can rearrange SSS to 111011101110 for which the tax charged will be 333 which is the minimum value of tax.\nTest Case 2: The tax charged for the string S=00000S = 00000S=00000 is 000 which can not be reduced further.'
