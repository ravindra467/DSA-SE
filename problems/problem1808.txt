b'Problem\nAnkur and Prateek are friends. Ankur has completed the Computer Network course and Prateek is improving his problem-solving skill. Prateek gives a String SSS to Ankur and asked him to decode it and find an IP address (IPv4) of Class B (128 - 191) in binary. Prateek gives a hint that after sorting the given string, the first element of each octet will help to find the solution. Ankur is new in programming and he wants your help to solve the problem.\nSee the explanation for more details.\nInput:\n\nThe first and only line consist of string SSS made of upper case English alphabets [A - Z].\n\nOutput:\n\nPrint IP address (IPv4) of class B in binary in a single line.\n\nConstraints\n\nLength of String SSS is  353535\n\nSample Input:\nABCDABCD.ABCDABCD.ABCDABCD.ABCDABCD   \n\nSample Output:\n10000000.10000001.10000010.10000011   \n\nEXPLANATION:\nAfter sorting the given string we find AAAAAAAA.BBBBBBBB.CCCCCCCC.DDDDDDDDAAAAAAAA.BBBBBBBB.CCCCCCCC.DDDDDDDDAAAAAAAA.BBBBBBBB.CCCCCCCC.DDDDDDDD and converting in binary A,B,C,A, B, C,A,B,C, and DDD will be 10000000,10000001,10000010,10000000, 10000001, 10000010,10000000,10000001,10000010, and 100000111000001110000011 respectively.'
