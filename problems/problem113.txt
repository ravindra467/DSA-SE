b'Problem\nIn Domino Solitaire, you have a grid with two rows and NNN columns. Each square in the grid contains an integer AAA. You are given a supply of rectangular 2\xc3\x9712 \\times 12\xc3\x971 tiles, each of which exactly covers two adjacent squares of the grid. You have to place tiles to cover all the squares in the grid such that each tile covers two squares and no pair of tiles overlap.\nThe score for a tile is the di\xef\xac\x80erence between the bigger and the smaller number that is covered by the tile. The aim of the game is to maximize the sum of the scores of all the tiles.\nHere is an example of a grid, along with two different tilings and their scores.The score for Tiling 111 is 12 = (9 \xe2\x88\x92 8) + (6 \xe2\x88\x92 2) + (7 \xe2\x88\x92 1) + (3 \xe2\x88\x92 2) while the score for Tiling\xc2\xa0222 is 6 = (8 \xe2\x88\x92 6) + (9 \xe2\x88\x92 7) + (3 \xe2\x88\x92 2) + (2 \xe2\x88\x92 1). There are other tilings possible for this grid,\xc2\xa0but you can check that Tiling 111 has the maximum score among all tilings.\xc2\xa0Your task is to read the grid of numbers and compute the maximum score that can be\xc2\xa0achieved by any tiling of the grid.\n\nYour task is to read the grid of numbers and compute the maximum score that can be achieved by any tiling of the grid.\nInput Format\nThe \xef\xac\x81rst line contains one integer NNN, the number of columns in the grid. This is followed by 222 lines describing the grid. Each of these lines consists of NNN integers, separated by blanks.\nOutput Format\nA single integer indicating the maximum score that can be achieved by any tiling of the given grid.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\leq A \\leq 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4A\xe2\x89\xa4104\n\n\nSubtasks\n\n\nSubtask 1 (100 points): Original constraints.\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4\n8 6 2 3\n9 7 1 212\nExplanation:\nExplained in the statement.'
