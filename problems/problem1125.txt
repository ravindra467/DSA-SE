It was already quiet late and so they decided to find a safe place to spend rest of  the night . They found a cave that was big and clean . They thought it was the best place to wait for dawn and then they could easily find their way  back to home . But Alas it was a cave of Gaint \xe2\x80\x9cYou know who\xe2\x80\x9d . At mid night Gaint , you know who came  back to his cave and caught sifat and his mysterious friend . \n\xc2\xa0\n  It was Sifat\xe2\x80\x99s good luck or bad luck Gaint \xe2\x80\x9cyou know who\xe2\x80\x9d was vegetarian but didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to lose the chance to play with sifat and his mysterious friend .  Gaint , \xe2\x80\x9cyou know who\xe2\x80\x9d used to be a problem  solver so he told sifat that he would give him a sentence \xe2\x80\x9cS\xe2\x80\x9d and a word \xe2\x80\x9cs\xe2\x80\x9d . Sifat had to find how many times word \xe2\x80\x9cs\xe2\x80\x9d occurs as a substring of \xe2\x80\x9cS\xe2\x80\x9d ( you can safely omit all spaces from the sentence in order to find the substring occurrence ) .  \xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\nInput starts with a integer T ( T <= 30 ) , denoting the number of test cases . \nEach case starts with two line . First line contains \xe2\x80\x98S\xe2\x80\x99 and second line contains \xe2\x80\x98s\xe2\x80\x99 . \nOutput\nFor each case first print case number and then print number of times s occurs as a substring in S after removing all spaces from S . \nConstraints\n\n1 <= T <=  30\n1 <=  length(S)  <=  100000 \n1 <=  length(s)  <=  length(S) \n\nExample\nInput:\n4\naxb ycz d\nabc\nab  cab cabc abc\nabc\naab acbaa bbaaz\naab\naaaaaa\naa\nOutput:\nCase 1: 0\nCase 2: 4\nCase 3: 2\nCase 4: 5\n\xc2\xa0'
