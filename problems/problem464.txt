b'Problem\nToday is the day of the CCDSAP exam. Chef is responsible for monitoring the exam. The hall in which the exam will be held contains NNN seats (numbered 111 through NNN) arranged in a row. Initially, each seat is either empty or occupied by a participant in the exam. You are given a binary string SSS with length NNN; for each valid iii, the iii-th character of SSS is \'1\' if the iii-th seat is occupied or \'0\' if this seat is empty.\nChef wants to make sure that no two participants are sitting next to each other, in order to prevent cheating. To do this, Chef may perform a number of operations (possibly zero). In each operation, he can ask a participant to move from his seat to an adjacent seat, either to its left or right, if such a seat exists and is empty.\nFind the minimum number of operations required to make sure that no two participants are sitting next to each other (in adjacent seats), or determine that it is impossible.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nThe second line contains a single string SSS with length NNN.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum number of operations, or the string "impossible" if Chef cannot achieve his goal.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410,0001 \\le T \\le 10,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x971051 \\le N \\le 2 * 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x97105\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x88\x97105 2 * 10^52\xe2\x88\x97105\nthe exam has at least one participant\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points): the sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 5,0005,0005,000\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4\n3\n011\n5\n10111\n1\n1\n6\n0001111\nimpossible\n0\n3'
