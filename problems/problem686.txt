b"Problem\nRam plays a strange number game. There are NNN blocks numbered from  111  to NNN.\nAt the beginning of game ram is at  NNNth block and he wants to come at  111st block to win the game in minimum number of moves.\nIn one move, he can perform one of the following operations\n\nIf the number is power of two then divide it by  222  and that becomes the new position of Ram\nIf not then reduce it by the next lower number which is power of  222  which is Ram's new position\n\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nEach testcase contains an integer NNN (initial position of Ram).\n\nOutput:\nFor Each test case print a single line minimum number of moves.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq T \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41 \\leq N \\leq1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4 264 - 111\n\nSample Input:\n4\n1\n2\n3\n6\n\nSample Output:\n0\n1\n1\n2\n\n\n"
