b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Mandarin, Bengali, and Russian as well.\nAlice and Bob have a permutation of size NNN, so they started playing a game on it. They both have their own copies of an initial permutation on which they perform moves in turns. Note that although Bob's and Alice's permutations are initially similar in values, they are the not the same permutation; any move Alice makes only changes her permutation and not Bob's, and vice versa.\nAlice goes first. In one move, they can do the following on their respective permutations:\n\nChoose two indices iii and jjj and swap PiP_iPi\xe2\x80\x8b and PjP_jPj\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nThe player who sorts their permutation first, wins the game.\nBoth players play optimally. But unfortunately, on playing a lot of games, Alice won all of those. Bob realized that something is unfair and told Alice to play with some handicap.\nSo they mutually agreed that, Alice is given an extra potential array VVV of size NNN. Now Alice can do the following move only:\n\nChoose two indices iii and jjj such that, 0<Vi0 \\lt V_i0<Vi\xe2\x80\x8b AND 0<Vj0 \\lt V_j0<Vj\xe2\x80\x8b.\nIf no such indices exist, skip her turn.\nElse swap PiP_iPi\xe2\x80\x8b and PjP_jPj\xe2\x80\x8b and then decrement ViV_iVi\xe2\x80\x8b and VjV_jVj\xe2\x80\x8b by 111.\n\nBob plays as usual without any potential array. Alice goes first.\nReport who wins if both play optimally, and find the strategy for the winner. You also need to determine the shortest sequence of moves to victory.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains TTT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN - the size of the permutation.\nThe next line contains NNN space separated integers P1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PNP_1, P_2, \\dots, P_NP1\xe2\x80\x8b,P2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,PN\xe2\x80\x8b.\nThe next line contains NNN space separated integers V1,V2,\xe2\x80\xa6,VNV_1, V_2, \\dots, V_NV1\xe2\x80\x8b,V2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,VN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case:\n\nOutput on the first line the winner of the match, i.e. Alice or Bob. You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings Alice, ALICE, alIcE and aLiCe will all be treated as identical).\nOutput on the next line an integer MMM - the minimum number of moves taken by the winner.\nThen output MMM lines, where the iii-th line contains two integers denoting the iii-th move by the winner.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq T \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq P_i \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Vi\xe2\x89\xa41091\\leq V_i \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Vi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\nP1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PNP_1, P_2, \\dots, P_NP1\xe2\x80\x8b,P2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,PN\xe2\x80\x8b form a permutation of values from 111 to NNN\n\xe2\x88\x91N\\sum N\xe2\x88\x91N over all test cases is at most 10510^5105\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n10\n1 8 10 4 2 5 7 9 3 6\n2 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 2\n10\n6 2 9 1 7 8 10 5 3 4\n2 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 1 2Bob\n6\n2 8\n2 9\n2 3\n2 10\n2 6\n2 5\nALiCE\n7\n3 9\n1 4\n4 10\n10 7\n7 5\n5 8\n8 6"
