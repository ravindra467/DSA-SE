b'Problem\n Read problems statements in Russian here\nPolo, the Penguin, has a lot of tests tomorrow at the university.\nHe knows that there are N different questions that will be on the tests. For each question i (i = 1..N), he knows C[i] - the number of tests that will contain this question, P[i] - the number of points that he will get for correctly answering this question on each of tests and T[i] - the amount of time (in minutes) that he needs to spend to learn this question.\nUnfortunately, the amount of free time that Polo has is limited to W minutes. Help him to find the maximal possible total number of points he can get for all tests if he studies for no more than W minutes.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains the pair of integers N and W, separated by a space. The following N lines contain three space-separated integers C[i], P[i] and T[i] (i = 1..N).\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponding test case.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 C[i], P[i], T[i] \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 W \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n3 7\n1 2 3\n2 3 5\n3 3 311\nExplanation:\nExample case 1. The best choice is to learn the first and the third questions and get 1*2 + 3*3 = 11 points.\n\xc2\xa0'
