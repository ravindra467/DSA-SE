b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nNikki has NNN coconuts, she wants to prepare a special coconut soup for her best friend Mansi. In order to make this soup, she has to break ZZZ coconuts. For each coconut, there is a fixed number of times Nikki needs to hit it if she wants it to break. Nikki can only hit one coconut at the same time.\nTheir friend Sakshi is a troublemaker. This time, Sakshi shuffled the coconuts in some (unknown) way. You are given a sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b with the following meaning: it is possible to label the coconuts 111 through NNN in such a way that for each valid iii, the iii-th coconut needs to be hit exactly AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b times to break.\nNikki wants to prepare the soup as soon as possible, so she wants to minimise the number of times she has to hit coconuts in the worst case in order to break ZZZ coconuts. Formally, she wants to find a strategy of hitting coconuts, possibly depending on which coconuts broke after which hits, such that no matter which coconuts broke and when, it is guaranteed that after HHH hits, there will be ZZZ broken coconuts, and there is no strategy with smaller HHH. Help Nikki find HHH \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum required number of hits.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and ZZZ.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum required number of hits.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le T \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Z\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\le  Z \\le N \\le 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4Z\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\le A_i \\le 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4106 for each valid iii\nthe sum of N\xe2\x8b\x85ZN \\cdot ZN\xe2\x8b\x85Z over all test cases does not exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x851063 \\cdot 10^63\xe2\x8b\x85106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le T \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45001 \\le N \\le 5001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4500\nZ=1Z = 1Z=1\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le A_i \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa41,000 for each valid iii\nthe sum of N\xe2\x8b\x85ZN \\cdot ZN\xe2\x8b\x85Z over all test cases does not exceed 3,0003,0003,000\n\nSubtask #2 (90 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n2 1\n50 55 \n2 1\n40 10055\n80\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: Nikki can choose one coconut and try to hit it 555555 times. It will break either after the 505050-th hit or after the 555555-th hit.\nExample case 2: Nikki can choose one coconut and hit it 404040 times. If it does not break, the other coconut must be the one that takes 404040 hits to break, so she should hit the other coconut 404040 times. In total, she needs to hit coconuts at most 808080 times.'
