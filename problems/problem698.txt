b"Problem\nSome professors are really cool, & their classes are interesting too. They don't stick to just academics, rather they make their students explore much beyond. On your first offline class, the professor gives you all a task which goes as follows:\nYou are given an array AAA of size NNN. You can apply the following operation to the array as many times as you want :\n\nSelect 2 integers LLL and RRR (1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq L \\leq R \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4N) specifying the indices of array and flip the bits (make 0 to 1 and 1 to 0) of all the elements of array present in range [L,R][L,R][L,R]. (Flipping here is meant only for the bits present at or after MSB. For example, if an array is [1,1,5,1,1][1,1,5,1,1][1,1,5,1,1] and L=2,R=4L=2, R=4L=2,R=4, then array will become [1,0,2,0,1][1,0,2,0,1][1,0,2,0,1], i.e., flipping all bits of A3=5(101)2A_3 = 5 (101)_2A3\xe2\x80\x8b=5(101)2\xe2\x80\x8b at or after MSB means making it equal to 2(010)22 (010)_22(010)2\xe2\x80\x8b, and similarly A2=A4=1A_2 = A_4 = 1A2\xe2\x80\x8b=A4\xe2\x80\x8b=1 is changed to 000).\n\nThe cost of each such operation is R\xe2\x88\x92L+1R-L+1R\xe2\x88\x92L+1, i.e., the size of the subarray chosen.\nYour task is to make all the elements of the array equal to zero. Find the minimum cost required for this. If there are multiple ways to achieve the same minimum cost, find the one with the minimum operations.\nInput Format\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nEach testcase contains two lines of input, first line contains a single integer NNN, size of the array.\nSecond line contains NNN space separated integers A1,A2,A3,...,ANA_1, A_2, A_3, ..., A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,A3\xe2\x80\x8b,...,AN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output two space separated integers, the minimum no. of required operations and the minimum cost.\n(Note that you have to print the minimum no. of operations such that the cost is minimum.)\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq T \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x971051 \\leq N \\leq 2*10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x97105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4230\xe2\x88\x9211 \\leq A_i \\leq 2^{30}-11\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4230\xe2\x88\x921\nSum of NNN over all test cases \xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x97105\\leq 2*10^5\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x97105\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n5\n1 1 5 1 1\n3\n4 8 23 7\n2 6\nExplanation:\nIn the first test case, 3 operations are applied as follows -\n\nChoose subarray 1 to 5 making array [0,0,2,0,0][0,0,2,0,0][0,0,2,0,0]\nChoose subarray 3 to 3 making array [0,0,1,0,0][0,0,1,0,0][0,0,1,0,0]\nChoose subarray 3 to 3 making array [0,0,0,0,0][0,0,0,0,0][0,0,0,0,0]\n\nIt can be verified that there is no other way to minimize no. of operations such that cost is minimum."
