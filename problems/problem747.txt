b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a matrix AAA with NNN rows (numbered 111 through NNN) and MMM columns (numbered 111 through MMM).\nYou need to fill the matrix with candies in such a way that:\n\nFor each cell, the number of candies in this cell is an integer between 000 and XXX inclusive.\nFor each pair of adjacent cells, the number of candies in one cell plus the number of candies in the other cell does not exceed YYY. Two cells are considered adjacent if they share a side.\n\nFind the maximum number of candies you can place in the given matrix.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers NNN, MMM, XXX and YYY.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the maximum number of candies.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le T \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le N, M \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X,Y\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\le X, Y \\le 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4X,Y\xe2\x89\xa4104\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n4 4 4 6\n3 4 4 548\n30'
