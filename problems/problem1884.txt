b'Problem\n"Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light."\nHarry already had a terrifying experience against the dementors. To protect himself against the dementors, he spent the winters mastering a spell SSS with Professor Remus Lupin. He had learned that the lexicographically smaller the spell SSS, the more powerful it is.\nHarry and Sirius Black were fighting dementors near the Great Lake. But since the number of dementors were way too large therefore he had to make the spell as powerful as possible.\nNow, he can change the spell SSS to S\xe2\x80\x99S\xe2\x80\x99S\xe2\x80\x99 (making it stronger) by using mmm passes of the form (c1c_1c1\xe2\x80\x8b,c2c_2c2\xe2\x80\x8b).\nIn each pass, he can change any character c1c_1c1\xe2\x80\x8b of the spell to c2c_2c2\xe2\x80\x8b.\nTo defeat all the dementors he has to create the most powerful spell possible by using any of the given mmm passes as many times as he want.\nInput:\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nNext line of each test case contains two integers nnn and mmm, the length of the string and the number of passes.\nNext line contains the spell SSS.\nNext mmm lines contain 222 characters c1c_1c1\xe2\x80\x8b, c2c_2c2\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case on a new line print the most powerful spell S\xe2\x80\xb2S\'S\xe2\x80\xb2 that Harry can create using the mmm passes any number of times.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100001 \\leq T \\leq 100001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq L \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa41000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa425\xe2\x88\x97260 \\leq m \\leq 25*260\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa425\xe2\x88\x9726\nc1\xe2\x89\xa0c2c1\\neq c2c1\xee\x80\xa0=c2\nc1c_1c1\xe2\x80\x8b ,c2c_2c2\xe2\x80\x8b, and the spell SSS consists of lower case English alphabets only.\n\nSample Input:\n1\n15 5\nexpectopatronum\ne a\np z\nz c\nr v\nm b\nSample Output:\naxcactocatronub\nExplanation:\n\nIn index 0 and 3, we convert \'e\' to \'a\' using pass 1.\nIn index 2 and 7, we convert \'p\' to \'z\' using pass 2 and \'z\' to \'c\' using pass 3.\nIn index 14, we convert \'m\' to \'b\' using pass 5.\n'
