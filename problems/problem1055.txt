b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.\nToday, Chef decided to cook some delicious meals from the ingredients in his kitchen. There are NNN ingredients, represented by strings S1,S2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SNS_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_NS1\xe2\x80\x8b,S2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,SN\xe2\x80\x8b. Chef took all the ingredients, put them into a cauldron and mixed them up.\nIn the cauldron, the letters of the strings representing the ingredients completely mixed, so each letter appears in the cauldron as many times as it appeared in all the strings in total; now, any number of times, Chef can take one letter out of the cauldron (if this letter appears in the cauldron multiple times, it can be taken out that many times) and use it in a meal. A complete meal is the string "codechef". Help Chef find the maximum number of complete meals he can make!\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nNNN lines follow. For each iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le i \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the iii-th of these lines contains a single string SiS_iSi\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum number of complete meals Chef can create.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le T \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le N \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n\xe2\x88\xa3S1\xe2\x88\xa3+\xe2\x88\xa3S2\xe2\x88\xa3+\xe2\x80\xa6+\xe2\x88\xa3SN\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa41,000|S_1| + |S_2| + \\ldots + |S_N| \\le 1,000\xe2\x88\xa3S1\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\xa3+\xe2\x88\xa3S2\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\xa3+\xe2\x80\xa6+\xe2\x88\xa3SN\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa41,000\neach string contains only lowercase English letters\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n6\ncplusplus\noscar\ndeck\nfee\nhat\nnear\n5\ncode\nhacker\nchef\nchaby\ndumbofe\n5\ncodechef\nchefcode\nfehcedoc\ncceeohfd\ncodechef1\n2\n5\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: After mixing, the cauldron contains the letter \'c\' 3 times, the letter \'e\' 4 times, and each of the letters \'o\', \'d\', \'h\' and \'f\' once. Clearly, this is only enough for one "codechef" meal.\nExample case 2: After mixing, the cauldron contains the letter \'c\' 4 times, \'o\' 2 times, \'d\' 2 times, \'e\' 4 times, \'h\' 3 times and \'f\' 2 times, which is enough to make 2 meals.'
