b"Problem\nYou are given KKK colours and a directed graph with NNN nodes numbered from 1 to N and MMM edges (there are no self-loops and no multiple edges).\nYou have to colour the graph in such a manner that if two nodes uuu and vvv are linked in such a way that there is a path from uuu to vvv and also from vvv to uuu, both nodes should have the same colour.\nWhereas either any of the two paths or both paths described above does not exist between uuu and vvv, they shouldn't be of the same colour.\nYou have to find the number of ways in which you can colour the graph following the above-mentioned rules. If it is not possible to colour the graph, return -1.\nInput:\n\nThe first line will contain TTT, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single line of input, three space-separated integers KKK NNN MMM(the number of colours available, the number of nodes and the number of edges).\nNext MMM lines contain two space-separated integers, uuu vvv, denoting an edge between the two nodes.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, output the number of ways in which you can colour the graph modulo 1000000007.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4201 \\leq T \\leq 201\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa420\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa45001 \\leq K \\leq 5001\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4500\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\leq N \\leq 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x88\x971041 \\leq M \\leq 5 * 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x88\x97104\n\nSample Input:\n2\n3 3 2\n1 2\n1 3\n2 3 2\n1 2\n1 3\n\nSample Output:\n6\n-1\n### EXPLANATION:\n\nFor test case 1, there are no two nodes which have paths as mentioned in the problem statement, hence they all should be of different colours. So, the number of ways to colour them using 3 colours is 6.\nFor test case 2, we are in the same situation as test case 1 but now we have only 2 colours. Since we need to colour all the nodes differently, we can't do it in 2 colours.  So, the answer is -1."
