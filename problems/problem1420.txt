b"Problem\nIt's Diwali season and you and your brother have received NNN chocolate bars from your relatives. Now you and your brother want to divide the chocolate amongst yourselves. Being elder it's your responsibility to cut the bars into multiple pieces (KKK at most). Your brother will take the largest amongst all the pieces, now you need to divide the bars such that he receives the smallest possible bar.\n\nYou have NNN chocolate bars of lengths C1,C2,...CnC1, C2, ...CnC1,C2,...Cn.\n\nWhen you cut a chocolate bar of length L whose distance from an end is t (0<t<L)(0 \\lt t \\lt L)(0<t<L), it becomes two chocolate bars of lengths ttt and LLL \xe2\x88\x92 ttt.\nInput Format\n\nFirst-line will contain NNN and KKK, the number of chocolate bars, and the maximum number of cuts possible.\nNext line will contain NNN integers C1,C2,....CnC1, C2, ....CnC1,C2,....Cn denoting length of each chocolate bar.\n\nOutput Format\n\nPrint a single value after rounding it up to an integer denoting the shortest possible length of the longest chocolate bar.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x971051 \\leq N \\leq 2*10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x97105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41090 \\leq K \\leq 10^90\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4109\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ci\xe2\x89\xa41090 \\leq Ci \\leq 10^90\xe2\x89\xa4Ci\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2 3\n5 7\n3\n\nExplanation:\nFirst, we cut 7 into 3 parts with help of 2 cuts making 3 bars of size 2.33 each. Next, we cut 5 into 2 parts using 1 cut making 2 bars of size 2.5 each. Rounding the largest bar that is 2.5 gives 3.\nSample 2:\nInputOutput3 1\n3 4 5\n4\n\nExplanation:\nWe cut the chocolate bar of size 5 into 2 parts making 2 bars of size 2.5 each. The largest bar we get is size 4."
