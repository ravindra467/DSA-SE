b"Problem\nOur hero Jonathan Joestar has come to the supermarket to buy apples. However, each apple has different nutritional value and a different cost. On top of that, some apples might be poisoned.\r\nLuckily Jonathan's grandfather Joseph Joestar has already informed him which apples are poisoned.\nJonathan has only a fixed amount of money. Help Jonathan choose apples with the maximum nutritional value that he can buy avoiding all apples that have been poisoned.\nInput:\n\nFirst-line will contain 3 integers N,B,MN, B, MN,B,M representing the number of apples, number of poisoned apples, amount of money that JoJo has.\nNext 2 lines contain NNN space-separated integers denoting the cost and nutritional value of the ith apples. Let those lists be called cost,nutritioncost, nutritioncost,nutrition.\nNext line contains B space-separated integers denoting indexes of the apples that are bad. (0-indexed). Let this list be called badbadbad.\n\nOutput:\nOutput a single integer containing the total nutritional value of the apples that JoJo can buy with the money so that none of the apples is poisoned and the nutritional value is maximum.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,B,M\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq N, B, M \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4N,B,M\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4cost[i]\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq cost[i] \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4cost[i]\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4nutrition[i]\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq nutrition[i] \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4nutrition[i]\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4bad[i]\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x9210 \\leq bad[i] \\leq N-10\xe2\x89\xa4bad[i]\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x921\n\nSample Input:\n 4 1 10\r\n 2 5 7 5\r\n 125 22 569 544\r\n 1\n\nSample Output:\n  694\n\nEXPLANATION:\nSince 2nd apples, is poisoned JoJo cannot choose it.
