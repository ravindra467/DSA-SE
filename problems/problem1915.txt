b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nRoger loves drawing polygons. For an arbitrary sequence of points in a 2D plane P0,P1,\xe2\x80\xa6,PM\xe2\x88\x921P_0, P_1, \\ldots, P_{M-1}P0\xe2\x80\x8b,P1\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,PM\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x80\x8b, he can draw a polygon with MMM sides by connecting the points PiP_iPi\xe2\x80\x8b and P(i+1)%MP_{(i+1)\\%M}P(i+1)%M\xe2\x80\x8b with a straight line segment for each valid iii. As a result, any point forms a polygon with M=1M = 1M=1, any two distinct points also form a polygon with M=2M = 2M=2 and a polygon may have sides with length 000.\nRoger calls a multiset SSS of MMM integers polygonable if there is a polygon created from a sequence with size MMM (as defined above) such that the multiset of its side lengths is equal to SSS. For example, the multisets (0,0)(0, 0)(0,0), (1,3,3)(1, 3, 3)(1,3,3) or (9,9)(9, 9)(9,9) are all polygonable, but (4)(4)(4) and (2,5,8)(2, 5, 8)(2,5,8) are not.\nRoger has a tree with NNN vertices (numbered 111 through NNN), where each edge is coloured in one of KKK colours (numbered 111 through NNN). He wants to pick an unordered pair of distinct vertices in the tree and create a multiset S=(S1,S2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SK)S = (S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_K)S=(S1\xe2\x80\x8b,S2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,SK\xe2\x80\x8b), where SiS_iSi\xe2\x80\x8b is the number of edges on the path between the chosen vertices which have colour iii. Now, Roger is wondering: in how many ways can he pick a pair of vertices such that the resulting multiset SSS is polygonable? Find the number of such pairs.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and KKK.\nEach of the next N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains three space-separated integers vvv, uuu and ccc, denoting an edge with colour ccc between vertices vvv and uuu.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the number of valid pairs.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\le T \\le 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051 \\le N \\le 2 \\cdot 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\le K \\le 101\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le u, v \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa4K1 \\le c \\le K1\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa4K\nthe graph described on the input is a tree\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052 \\cdot 10^52\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n5 3\n1 2 1\n1 3 2\n2 4 3\n2 5 2\n6 2\n1 2 1\n2 3 1\n3 4 2\n4 5 1\n5 6 25\n4'
