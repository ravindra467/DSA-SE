b'Problem\nChef is deriving weird ways to sort his array. Currently he is trying to sort his arrays in increasing order by reversing some of his subarrays.\nTo make it more challenging for himself, Chef decides that he can reverse only those subarrays that have sum of its elements at most XXX. Soon he notices that it might not be always possible to sort the array with this condition.\nCan you help the Chef by telling him if the given array can be sorted by reversing subarrays with sum at most XXX.\nMore formally, for a given array AAA and an integer XXX, check whether the array can be sorted in increasing order by reversing some (possibly none) of the subarrays such that the sum of all elements of the subarray is at most XXX.\nInput Format\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains of two space-separated integers NNN and XXX denoting the length of the array and the maximum sum of subarrays that you can reverse.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers A1,A2,...,ANA_1, A_2,..., A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,...,AN\xe2\x80\x8b representing the initial array.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output YES\\texttt{YES}YES if Chef can sort the array using a finite number of operations, else output NO\\texttt{NO}NO.\nYou may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YeS\\texttt{YeS}YeS, yEs\\texttt{yEs}yEs, yes\\texttt{yes}yes and YES\\texttt{YES}YES will all be treated as identical).\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851041 \\leq T \\leq 5\\cdot 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851091 \\leq A_i \\leq 2\\cdot 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851091 \\leq X \\leq 2\\cdot 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85109\nSum of NNN over all test cases does not exceeds 3\xe2\x8b\x851053\\cdot 10^53\xe2\x8b\x85105.\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n4 1\n1 2 3 4\n4 1\n2 1 3 4\n5 7\n3 2 2 3 3\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\nExplanation:\nTest case 111: The array is already sorted so we need not make any operations.\nTest case 222: There is no subarray with sum less than or equal to 111 so we cannot sort the array.\nTest case 333: We can reverse the subarray A[1,3]A[1, 3]A[1,3] which has a sum of 3+2+2=73+2+2=73+2+2=7. Thus, the reversed subarray is [2,2,3][2, 2, 3][2,2,3]. The resulting array is [2,2,3,3,3][2, 2, 3, 3, 3][2,2,3,3,3]. The array is sorted in 111 operation.'
