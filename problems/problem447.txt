b'Problem\nLeonardo is the best friend of the chef and a good mathematician also. When the chef is stuck in any problem he asks for help from his friend Leonardo.\nUnfortunately, the chef is stuck in a problem and asks from his mathematician friend to calculate the sum from position LLL to RRR (Inclusive) of the special Fibonacci sequence.\nSpecial fibbonacci sequence (sf)(sf)(sf) is defined as 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,3\xe2\x80\xa6...0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3\xe2\x80\xa6...0,1,1,2,3,5,8,3\xe2\x80\xa6... i.e. the ithi^{th}ith term of the series is the ithi^{th}ith term of fibonacci sequence modulo 101010.\nFormarly, Leonardo has to calculate  v= \xe2\x88\x91i=LR sfi\nIf the given range is invalid, print \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921\nCONSTRAINTS.\n1<=T<=10^4\n0<=L<=10^7\n0<=R<=10^7\nINPUT\nFirst contains number of testcases T .\nEach testcases contains single line two space separated integer L and R.\nOUTPUT\nPrint a singe line value of v if possible else print -1.\nSAMPLE INPUT\n3\n1 4\n0 5\n3 3\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\n7\n12\n2\nEXPLANATION\nf1%10 =1+ f2 %10=1+ f3%10 =2 + f4%10=3 is  7\nf0%10= 0+f1%10=1+ f2%10 =1+f3 %10=2+f4%10=3+f5%10=5 is 12\nf3%10=2 is 2\nSum is possible if  R-L is Non-negative.\n'
