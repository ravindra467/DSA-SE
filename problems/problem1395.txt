Also he explores all M-letter words formed by the characters he knows. Define cost for a given M-letter word S, cost(S) = P1, S1+P2, S2+...+PM, SM, where Pi, j is i, jth entry of matrix P. Sort all the words by descending cost, if costs are equal, sort them lexicographically. You need to find K-th M-letter word in Chef's order.\n\nInput\nFirst line contains three positive integer numbers N, M and K.\nNext M lines contains N integers per line, denoting the matrix P.\nOutput\nOutput in a single line K-th M-letter in Chef's order.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 16 \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 10 \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 NM\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 Pi, j \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1: (20 points) 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 10000\nSubtask #2: (20 points) 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 5\nSubtask #3: (60 points) Original constraints\n\nExample\nInput:\n2 5 17\n7 9\n13 18\n10 12\n4 18\n3 9\nOutput:\naaaba\n"
