He tells him that he will definitely help him if Rahul can solve a very easy question.\nThe question is to find all the even coefficient in the binomial expansion of (1+x)^N for a given value of N.\nFor example suppose the value of n is 3.Then the expansion of (1+x)^3  is (1 + 3x + 3x^2 + x^3) and the coefficients are 1,3,3,1. So the number of even coefficients is 0.\nInput\nInput will be a single integer N as declared in the problem statement.\nOutput\nPrint a single integer corresponding to the given value of N.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 10000000\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\nOutput:\n0\nInput:\n4\nOutput:\n3\nExplanation\nExample 1 is explained in the problem statement.'
