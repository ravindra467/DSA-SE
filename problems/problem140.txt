Here are the rules of soccer for dogs:\n\nNNN dogs (numbered 111 through NNN) stand in a line in such a way that for each valid iii, dogs iii and i+1i + 1i+1 are adjacent.\nEach dog has a skill level, which is either 111 or 222.\nAt the beginning of the game, Chef passes a ball to dog 111 (dog 111 receives the ball).\nFor each valid iii, if dog iii has skill level sss, this dog can pass the ball to any dog with number jjj such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3i\xe2\x88\x92j\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4s1 \\le |i-j| \\le s1\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3i\xe2\x88\x92j\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4s.\nEach dog (including dog 111) may receive the ball at most once.\nWhenever a dog receives the ball, it must either pass it to another dog or finish the game by scoring a goal.\n\nWhile the dogs were playing, Chef also created a game for developers. He defined the result of a game of soccer for dogs as the sequence of dogs which received the ball in the order in which they received it. The last dog in the sequence is the dog that decided to score a goal; if a dog never received the ball, it does not appear in the sequence. In the game for developers, you should find the number of possible results of soccer for dogs.\nFind this number of possible results modulo 109+710^9 + 7109+7. Two results of soccer for dogs (sequences of dogs' numbers) are considered different if these sequences have different lengths or if there is a valid index iii such that the iii-th dog in one sequence is different from the iii-th dog in the other sequence.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b denoting the skill levels of the dogs.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the number of different results of soccer for dogs, modulo 109+710^9 + 7109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\le T \\le 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le N \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa421 \\le A_i \\le 21\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa42 for each valid iii\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): N\xe2\x89\xa410N \\le 10N\xe2\x89\xa410\nSubtask #2 (30 points): N\xe2\x89\xa4103N \\le 10^3N\xe2\x89\xa4103\nSubtask #3 (60 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n4\n1 1 1 1\n3\n2 2 2\n4\n1 2 1 14\n5\n6\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: The following results are possible: 111, [1,2][1, 2][1,2], [1,2,3][1, 2, 3][1,2,3], [1,2,3,4][1, 2, 3, 4][1,2,3,4].\nExample case 2: The following results are possible: [1][1][1], [1,2][1, 2][1,2], [1,2,3][1, 2, 3][1,2,3], [1,3,2][1, 3, 2][1,3,2], [1,3][1, 3][1,3]."
