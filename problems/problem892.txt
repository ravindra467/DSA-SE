If it\'s possible, output "Possible", otherwise output "Impossible".\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains the pair of integers N and M denoting the size of the grid.\nThe next N lines contain M characters each. The characters can be one of the following ones:\n\n\'.\' denoting an empty cell.\n\'E\' denoting an enemy.\n\'L\' denoting a laser.\n\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the answer to the corresponing test case.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N, M \xe2\x89\xa4 50\nThe number of lasers will be between 1 and 16, inclusive.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n3\n2 2\nE.\nL.\n2 4\nE.EL\nLL..\n3 3\nEE.\nL.L\nL..\nOutput:\nPossible\nPossible\nImpossible\n'
