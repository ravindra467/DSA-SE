b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef owns NNN cars (numbered 111 through NNN). He wishes to sell all of them over NNN years by selling exactly one car per year. For each valid iii, the initial price of the iii-th car is PiP_iPi\xe2\x80\x8b. Due to depreciation, the price of each car decreases by 111 unit per year until it is sold.\nNote that the price of a car cannot drop below 000 no matter how many years have passed, i.e. when the price of a car reaches 000 in some year, it remains 000 in all subsequent years.\nFind the maximum profit Chef can make if he sells his cars in an optimal way. Since this number may be large, compute it modulo 1,000,000,0071,000,000,0071,000,000,007 (109+710^9+7109+7).\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers P1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PNP_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_NP1\xe2\x80\x8b,P2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,PN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the maximum profit Chef can make, modulo 1,000,000,0071,000,000,0071,000,000,007.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4251 \\le T \\le 251\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa425\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le N \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa41090 \\le P_i \\le 10^90\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid iii\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85103N \\le 2 \\cdot 10^3N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85103\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n3\n6 6 6\n3\n0 1 015\n1\nExplanation:\nExample case 1:\n\nDuring the first year, Chef's profit so far is 000 and the prices of the cars are [6,6,6][6,6,6][6,6,6].

Chef sells one of these cars.\nDuring the third year, Chef's profit so far is 111 and there is one car with price 000. Chef sells this car.\nDuring the fourth year, Chef has sold all his cars and his profit is 111.\n"
