b'Problem\nNOOB is in bizarre habit of counting everything. So one day he decided to count number of ways in which he can visit a very popular miraculous city Chefland. Chefland is a rooted tree consisting of nnn vertices with the root at vertex 111. Vertex 111 is also the only entrance in Chefland and every leaf vertex contains an  exit door. But there is a problem. Some of the vertices are poisonous. If he visits consecutive mmm poisonous vertices he will eventually die, otherwise he succussfully visits that city. NOOB feels some difficulties solving this problem and needs your in finding number of possible ways?\nInput:\n\nFirst line contains two integers nnn(number of vertices in chefland ) and mmm(maximum number of consecutive poisonous cities).\nSecond line contains n integers a1,a2,a3...,aNa1,a2,a3...,aN a1,a2,a3...,aN where each aiaiai is either 111(if vertex is poisonous) otherwise 000.\nNext n\xe2\x88\x921n-1n\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains edges of the tree in the format of p1,p2p1, p2p1,p2 where p1p1p1 and p2p2p2 are vertices of the tree connected by an edge.\n\nOutput:\n\nprint a single integer - maximum number of ways.\n\nConstraints\n\n2\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41042 \\leq n \\leq 10^42\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4n1 \\leq m \\leq n1\xe2\x89\xa4m\xe2\x89\xa4n\n\nSample Input::\n9 2\r\n1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0\r\n1 2\r\n1 3 \r\n2 4\r\n4 5\r\n4 6\r\n2 7\r\n3 8\r\n3 9\n\nSample Output:\n2\n\nEXPLANATION:\nThere are two possible ways when Chef exit from vertex 666 and 777.'
