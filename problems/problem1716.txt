b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Russian , Vietnamese , Hindi, Mandarin chinese and Bengali as well.\nChef has a difficult problem to solve. He has NNN segments [l1,r1],[l2,r2],\xe2\x80\xa6,[lN,rN][l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], \\dots, [l_N, r_N][l1\xe2\x80\x8b,r1\xe2\x80\x8b],[l2\xe2\x80\x8b,r2\xe2\x80\x8b],\xe2\x80\xa6,[lN\xe2\x80\x8b,rN\xe2\x80\x8b] on the xxx-axis. A KKK-subset of these NNN segments consists of any KKK of these segments. For each KKK-subset, consider the common intersection of all the KKK segments, i.e. the set of points which belong to each of the KKK segments. The intersection of segments is also a segment; the length of a segment [l,r][l, r][l,r] is r\xe2\x88\x92lr-lr\xe2\x88\x92l. Chef is asking you to find the maximum of lengths of the common intersections in all KKK-subsets.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and KKK.\nNNN lines follow. For each iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le i \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the iii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers lil_ili\xe2\x80\x8b and rir_iri\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum length of a common intersection.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le T \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le K \\le N \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4li\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\le l_i \\le r_i \\le 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4li\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4ri\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x851055 \\cdot 10^55\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points): the sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 10410^4104\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints\nExample Input\n1\n3 2\n1 6\n2 4\n3 6\n\nExample Output\n3\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: A 222-subset is a pair of segments. The common intersections of all pairs are:\n\nfor the first and second segment, the intersection is the segment [2,4][2, 4][2,4] with length 222\nfor the second and third segment, the intersection is the segment [3,4][3, 4][3,4] with length 111\nfor the first and third segment, the intersection is the segment [3,6][3, 6][3,6] with length 333\n'
