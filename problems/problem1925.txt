The ith integer denotes Ai, the number of items offered by the ith shop. and Pi, Ai denoting the number of items, while Pi denoting the Price for the deal at shop i. \nThe next line contain n space seperated integers. The ith interger denotes Pi, the Price for the deal at shop i.\nThe next line contains a single integer k denoting the budget for the shopping campaign.\nOutput\nFor every testcase output a single integer M in a new line, denoting the maximum no. of items that can be purchased in the given market conditions with the given budget.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 600\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i, j \xe2\x89\xa4 n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 k \xe2\x89\xa4 12*10^3\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Pi \xe2\x89\xa4 k\n\nExample\nInput:\n7\n3 1\n2 1\n7 6\n6 3\n5 3\n4 3\n4 7 7 2 3 4 7\n2 1 3 6 2 3 1\n5\n\nOutput:\n14\n\nHint: Leave first shop->move to shop 3->purchase there->move to shop 6->leave it->move to shop 7->purchase there. purchased items=7+7=14, spend budget= 3+1=4 <5."
