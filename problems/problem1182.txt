b'Problem\nYou are given 222 string AAA and BBB and an integer KKK. You have to find a substring of length KKK such that it is common in both the strings i.e. present in both String AAA and BBB.\nA substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string. For Example, string "bite" is substring of string "biteration", but string "bion" is not.\nIf there are multiple such KKK length substrings which are present in both AAA and BBB, then you have to find the one which occurs maximum no of times in both strings combined i.e. the sum of occurrences in both the strings is maximum.\nIf still, there are multiple such KKK length substrings with max Occurrence and common in both, then u have to find the one which is lexicographically smallest among them.\nInput:\n\nFirst line contains number of Test Cases TTT.\nFirst line of each Test Case contains 333 integers NNN, MMM and KKK, denoting Length of string AAA, length of string BBB and Length of Common Substring respectively.\nNext 222 lines contains the strings AAA and BBB respectively consisting only of lowercase Latin characters.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, in a single line, you have to output the required common substring, or if no such substring exists, output "-1"(without quotes).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4201 \\leq T \\leq 201\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa420\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x971051 \\leq N,M \\leq 2*10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x88\x97105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4min(N,M)1 \\leq K \\leq min(N,M)1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4min(N,M)\nSum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x88\x971052*10^52\xe2\x88\x97105\nSum of MMM over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x88\x971052*10^52\xe2\x88\x97105\n\nSubtasks\n\n15 points : 1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq N,M \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4100\n36 points : 1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq N,M \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41000\n99 points : Original Constraints\n\nSample Input:\n3\n7 6 4\nabababc\nbababa\n3 4 1\nabb\naabb\n4 4 3\naabb\nabab\n\nSample Output:\nabab\nb\n-1\n### EXPLANATION:\n\nIn the first example, "abab" and "baba" are 222 substrings which are common while "babc" is not.\nSum of occurrences of "abab" is 3(2 in A + 1 in B) and of "baba" is also 3(1 in A and 2 in B).\nSo, we need to take the lexicographically smaller among them, which is abab\nIn the second example, "a" and "b" are common substrings, but since string "b" has greater sum of occurrences, ans is "b".\nIn the third example, since there is no common substring of length 333, the ans is "-1".'
