b"Problem\nIn the cursed land of earth where all crops are failing, Tom Cooper is trying to grow nnn acres of crop this season, and he can grow one crop in an acre. Tom has two sets of nnn crop seeds each. In the two sets, the two ithi^{th}ith crop seeds are the same type crop.\nThe first set of nnn crop seeds are independent and each of them require their own preparation and can be grown independently. The ithi^{th}ith crop under this category will take a cost of xix_ixi\xe2\x80\x8b.\nThe second set of nnn crops are genetically modified to withstand extreme conditions and even withstand the intense dust storms. But there is one thing: to allot a proper usage of resources, the crops are designed in such a way that the ithi^{th}ith crop can be directly grown without fertiliser or other resource if the genetically modified (i\xe2\x88\x921)th(i-1)^{th}(i\xe2\x88\x921)th crop is grown: that is, for example, the waste material of the (i\xe2\x88\x921)th(i-1)^{th}(i\xe2\x88\x921)th crop can be fertiliser for the ithi^{th}ith crop, etc. Thus he can grow the ithi^{th}ith crop in them in a constant ccc cost along with a preparation cost of ckick_icki\xe2\x80\x8b but if he has also grown the (i\xe2\x88\x921)th(i-1)^{th}(i\xe2\x88\x921)th genetically modified crop, he can skip the preparation cost and grow the ithi^{th}ith crop in just ccc cost.\nSince the world market expects a lot of variety in the crops available, Tom wants to maximize the number of different types of crops he grows. That is for example, Tom can grow only genetically modified crop 1 on all his fields. In that case, he grows 1 crop. Tom wants to maximize this number of crops he grows. Note that growing both genetically modified and normal versions of the same crop count as growing 1 crop only, and not 2.\nThus, Tom wants you to find out the maximum number of different crops he can grow, and the corresponding minimum cost at which he can grow n sets of crops.\nInput format\n\nThe first line contains TTT, the number of test cases.\nFor each test case, the first line contains two numbers nnn and ccc.\nThe second line has nnn integers x1x_1x1\xe2\x80\x8b,x2x_2x2\xe2\x80\x8b,...,xnx_nxn\xe2\x80\x8b.\nThe third line has nnn integers k1k_1k1\xe2\x80\x8b,k2k_2k2\xe2\x80\x8b,...,knk_nkn\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq T \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\leq n \\leq 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq c \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x[i]\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq x[i] \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4x[i]\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4k[i]\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq k[i] \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4k[i]\xe2\x89\xa410\n\nOutput format\nFor each test case, output a line having two integers - the maximum number of different crops that can be grown, and the minimum cost that'll be taken for this set of crops.\nSample Input\n2\r\n5 3\r\n1 3 1 2 1\r\n1 1 1 1 2\r\n3 2\r\n100 100 100\r\n1 1 1\n\nSample Output\n5 8\r\n3 8\n"
