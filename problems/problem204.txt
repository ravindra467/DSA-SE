b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nNikitas does not want to study for his exams, so he decided to become a disruptor and get a part-time job as a tax collector in Airland. Airland consists of NNN houses (numbered 111 through NNN) and MMM one-way supply pathways that connect them. Each house has a budget; let's denote the budget of house iii by BiB_iBi\xe2\x80\x8b (in coins). The neighbourhood of a house is the set of houses which both can supply this house and can be supplied from this house. (directly or indirectly, including itself)\nNikitas can choose to start his tax-collecting journey at any house. Then, he can move along supply pathways to visit more houses and collect taxes on the way. For each valid iii, when Nikitas visits house iii for the first time (including the house where he starts the journey), but hasn't visited any house in the neighbourhood of house iii before, then he must choose a positive integer ccc and announce to each house in this neighbourhood that it should pay ccc coins in taxes.\nWhenever a house with a budget bbb is asked to pay ccc coins, two things can happen. If c\xe2\x89\xa4bc \\le bc\xe2\x89\xa4b, this house pays the tax. If c>bc \\gt bc>b, this house cannot afford to pay the tax, so it does not pay anything. Note that no house may be asked to pay taxes twice.\nWhen the houses that can afford to pay the announced tax pay it, Nikitas can continue his journey in the same way until he cannot collect any more money. He has to be careful, though \xe2\x80\x95 at the end, if there are more than KKK houses that were asked to pay their tax, but did not pay because they could not afford it, the captain of Airland will take his katana and capture Nikitas, so he will end his tax-collecting journey without earning any money. Otherwise, Nikitas earns all the money he collected.\nNikitas wants to maximise the amount of money he will make. Luckily, you know all the information about the supply pathways in Airland, so you offer to help Nikitas calculate the maximum amount of money he can make without getting captured. Since this number may be large, compute it modulo 100000002110000000211000000021 (109+2110^9 + 21109+21).\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NNN, MMM and KKK.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BNB_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_NB1\xe2\x80\x8b,B2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN\xe2\x80\x8b.\nMMM lines follow. Each of these lines contains two space-separated integers uuu and vvv denoting the starting and ending house of a supply pathway.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the maximum amount of money Nikitas can make without being captured, modulo 100000002110000000211000000021 (109+2110^9+21109+21).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa451 \\le T \\le 51\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\n3\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41053 \\le N \\le 10^53\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051 \\le M \\le 2 \\cdot 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Bi\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\le B_i \\le 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Bi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid iii\n0\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa42000 \\le K \\le 2000\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4200\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 10510^5105\nthe sum of MMM over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052 \\cdot 10^52\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points):\n\nK=0K = 0K=0\n3\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,0003 \\le N \\le 1,0003\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851041 \\le M \\le 5 \\cdot 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85104\nthe sum of MMM over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x851045 \\cdot 10^45\xe2\x8b\x85104\n\nSubtask #2 (10 points):\n\nK=1K = 1K=1\n3\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,0003 \\le N \\le 1,0003\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851041 \\le M \\le 5 \\cdot 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85104\nthe sum of MMM over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x851045 \\cdot 10^45\xe2\x8b\x85104\n\nSubtask #3 (20 points):\n\n3\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,0003 \\le N \\le 1,0003\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851041 \\le M \\le 5 \\cdot 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85104\n0\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41000 \\le K \\le 1000\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4100\nthe sum of MMM over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x851045 \\cdot 10^45\xe2\x8b\x85104\n\nSubtask #4 (60 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n4 4 1\n2 8 15 9\n1 3\n2 1\n4 3\n3 225\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: Nikitas can start at house 444, and since it is not supplied from any other house, he can get 999 coins from it. Then, he can move to house 333 and he has to ask each house in the neighbourhood of house 333 (houses 111, 222 and 333, since house 222 supplies house 111 directly and house 333 indirectly through house 111, while house 333 supplies house 222 directly) to pay.\nSince K=1K = 1K=1, Nikitas will be okay if house 111 does not pay, so he can ask for 888 coins from each house. He gets 8\xe2\x8b\x852=168 \\cdot 2 = 168\xe2\x8b\x852=16 coins in total from houses 222 and 333. At the end, Nikitas earns 9+16=259 + 16 = 259+16=25 coins."
