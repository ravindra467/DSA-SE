b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef has a tree with NNN nodes (numbered 111 through NNN) and a non-negative integer xxx. The nodes of the tree have non-negative integer weights; let's denote the weight of node iii by aia_iai\xe2\x80\x8b.\nNext, let's define the XOR value of a tree as the bitwise XOR of weights of all its nodes.\nChef wants to remove zero or more edges from his tree in such a way that each individual tree in the forest formed by removing these edges has XOR value xxx. Help him compute the number of ways to remove a set of edges such that this condition is satisfied. Since the answer may be large, compute it modulo 109+710^9+7109+7.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers NNN and xxx.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aNa_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_Na1\xe2\x80\x8b,a2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,aN\xe2\x80\x8b.\nEach of the following N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two space-separated integers uuu and vvv denoting an edge between nodes uuu and vvv in Chef's tree.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the number of ways to remove edges, modulo 109+710^9+7109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le N \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa41090 \\le x \\le 10^90\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4109\n0\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa41090 \\le a_i \\le 10^90\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid iii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le u, v \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): N\xe2\x89\xa4100N \\le 100N\xe2\x89\xa4100\nSubtask #2 (20 points): N\xe2\x89\xa45,000N \\le 5,000N\xe2\x89\xa45,000\nSubtask #3 (70 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput7 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0 1 \n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n3 6\n3 75\nExplanation:\nThere are five valid ways to remove edges, splitting the tree into subtrees on nodes:\n\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and [7] by removing the edge (3-7)\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7] and [5] by removing the edge (2-5)\n[2, 4, 5] and [1, 3, 6, 7] by removing the edge (1-2)\n[2, 4, 5], [1], [3,6] and [7] by removing edges (1-2), (1-3) and (3-7)\n[1, 2, 4], [5], [3,6] and [7] by removing edges (2-5), (1-3) and (3-7)\n"
