b'Problem\nRead problems statements Bengali , Mandarin chinese , Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef is a cook. He has a son Chefu and a daughter Chefa. He also has NNN coins, numbered 111 through NNN; for each valid iii, the iii-th coin has value ViV_iVi\xe2\x80\x8b.\nChef wants to give all coins to his two children in the following way: He traverses all coins in a particular order; for each coin, he checks which child currently has less money in total and gives this coin to that child (if both have the same amount of money, Chefu is given the coin).\nChefu is studying computer science, so he knows that this method is not necessarily the most fair way of partitioning the coins, but Chef does not understand why, since he is only a cook.\nNow, Chefu wants to take advantage of that and choose the order in which Chef should give out the coins in such a way that the amount of money he gets is maximised. Can you help him?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers V1,V2,\xe2\x80\xa6,VNV_1, V_2, \\dots, V_NV1\xe2\x80\x8b,V2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,VN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing NNN space-separated integers \xe2\x80\x94 a permutation of numbers 111 through NNN denoting the indices of the coins in the order in which Chef should traverse them. If there is more than one optimal solution, you may print any one.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le T \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45001 \\le N \\le 5001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4500\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Vi\xe2\x89\xa45001 \\le V_i \\le 5001\xe2\x89\xa4Vi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4500 for each valid iii\nthe sum of NNN for all test cases does not exceed 500500500\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points): the sum of NNN for all test cases does not exceed 808080\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints\nExample Input\n2\n4\n5 3 20 9\n4\n2 2 2 2\n\nExample Output\n2 4 1 3\n1 2 3 4\n'
