b'Problem\nYou are a kid playing with rectangle blocks with sides of length xxx and yyy and height of 1 unit.\nYour friend gives you n blocks one by one. You can either accept the block or reject it. You want to stack the blocks such that the blocks form a tall tower. While stacking the blocks you make sure to only accept the block if and only if the block is smaller than the block on top right now.\nA block is smaller if it fits inside the boundaries of the block currently on top (i.e. doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stick out)\nNOTE: You can always reject a block if you want \nNOTE: You always stack the blocks such that the height of the tower increases by 1 unit every time\n\nYou need to find the maximum height of the tower possible if you already know the blocks which your friend is going to give you and in which order.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer nnn, the number of blocks your friend gives you\nThe next n lines are the blocks that your friend gives you in order\nEach line contain two space-separated integers xxx and yyy, the size of the block\n\nOutput Format\nOutput one integer, the maximum possible height of the tower\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq n \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa41062 \\leq x,y \\leq 10^62\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4106\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput9\n1000 1000\n950 920\n790 800\n805 830\n450 430\n777 744\n125 111\n530 580\n203 2546'
