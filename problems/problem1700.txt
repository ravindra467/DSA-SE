b"Problem\nVidya has a box containing NNN candies of different sweetness. She decided to distribute these candies among her three friends - 'ISH', 'OMI' and 'GOVI'. She opted a different strategy of distributing the candies. She picks three candies from the box randomly and distribute them in such a way that 'GOVI' gets the candy with minimum sweetness from the three picked candies. This process is repeated untill the box get emptied or contain less than three candies. What is the maximum total sweetness value of the candies that 'GOVI' can get at the end?\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases.\nEach testcase contains single line integer NNN.\nNext line contains NNN space separated integers,  where ith integer denotes the sweetness of ith candy.\n\nOutput:\n\nFor each test case output the maximum sweetness of candies that 'GOVI' get after the distribution is completed.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq T \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq K \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4105 , where K is the Sweetness of candy\n\nSample Input:\n1\r\n7\n\n1 3 2 5 6 11 7\nSample Output:\n8\n\nEXPLANATION:\nShe picks -> (6,11,7) and (3,2,5)\r\nMaximum Sweetness of Candies that 'Govi' gets -> 6 + 2 = 8"
