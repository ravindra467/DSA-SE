b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese and Bengali as well.\nChef has a random permutation P1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PNP_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_NP1\xe2\x80\x8b,P2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,PN\xe2\x80\x8b and an integer KKK.\nA subsequence (not necessarily contiguous) of this permutation is called good if it has at most KKK pairs of neighbouring elements such that the left element is larger than the right element.\nChef wants to know the maximum length of a good subsequence of his permutation. Can you help him?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers NNN and KKK.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers P1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PNP_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_NP1\xe2\x80\x8b,P2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,PN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the maximum length of a good subsequence.\nConstraints\n\n0\xe2\x89\xa4K<N\xe2\x89\xa450,0000 \\le K \\lt N \\le 50,0000\xe2\x89\xa4K<N\xe2\x89\xa450,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le P_i \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid iii\nthe permutation is chosen uniformly randomly among all permutations of the integers 111 through NNN; note that KKK is not independent from the chosen permutation (it can be chosen differently depending on the permutation)\n\nExample Input\n8 1\n2 7 6 3 4 1 8 5\n\nExample Output\n5\n\nExplanation\nOne good subsequence with the maximum length is [2,3,4,1,5][2, 3, 4, 1, 5][2,3,4,1,5].'
