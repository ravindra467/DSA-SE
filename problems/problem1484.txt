b"Problem\nIn the magic land, there is a smart but naughty boy Crane.\nCrane has n houses, and n friends (both numbered from 1 to n).\nCrane's mother has scheduled a plan for all his friends\nsuch that each friend visits each house of Crane exactly once\nat a different time, i.e.,\nthere is at most one friend in any house at any time.\n\n\nBut like Crane all his friends are also naughty.\nTherefore his mother wants to lock away each of his friends in distinct houses.\nWhat she'll do is to choose a distinct house for each friend. As that friend visits\nthat house, he'll be locked in that house.  That is, Crane's mother wants to find a \nsequence block such that\nthe i-th friend will be locked in block[i]-th house \nonce he visits that house. As she wants to ensure that there is at maximum one\nperson in each house, she must choose the sequence block such\nthat if friend A visits house H at time T, and he is locked away in the house, then no other friends visit house H\nafter time T. \n\n\nHelp Crane's mother to find such a sequence block. \nInput\nFirst line contains a single integer n (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n\n\xe2\x89\xa4 100), indicating the number of friends and houses.\nThen n lines follow, with each line containing n positive integers.\nThe j-th integer in i-th line indicates the time when the i-th friend will visit the j-th house. All times will fit in signed 32-bit integer.\nOutput\nIf there exists a sequence block that satisfies the constraints, then output block[1] block[2] ... block[n] in one line, separated by a single space.\nOtherwise if there is no such sequence, output -1 in one line.\nIf there are multiple answers, then anyone will do.\nExample\nInput:\n3\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9\n\nOutput:\n3 2 1\n"
