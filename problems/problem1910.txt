b'Problem\nYou are given a tree with NNN nodes, with each node numbered uniquely with 1..N.\nMovement from a particular node to its parent(if exists) is the only allowed move and it costs 1 rupee. That is from any node UUU we can go to parent(U) in 1 rupee, parent(parent(U)) in 2 rupees, parent(parent(parent(U))) in 3 rupees etc.\nWe have QQQ queries of the form rrr, uuu, vvv and each query is interpreted as follows:\n\nThe tree is rooted at rrr\nOne person is standing at uuu and another one is standing at vvv.\nBoth of them want to meet at a common location with each one spending as minimum as possible.\nThe answer to the query is xxx yyy, where xxx is the minimum cost for the person standing initially at uuu and yyy is the minimum cost for the person standing initially at vvv to meet in a common location.\n\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain two integers NNN and QQQ, the size of the tree and number of queries.\nIt is followed by N-1 lines with each line containing two space separated integers indicating an edge between the two nodes in the tree.\nIt is followed by QQQ lines, where each line has three space separated integers rrr uuu vvv, root of the tree, initial location of person 1 and initial location of person 2 respectively.\n\nOutput:\nFor each query output two integers xxx and yyy in a new line, where xxx is the cost for person 1 and yyy is the cost for person 2 to reach the common point.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N,Q \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N,Q\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Nodenumber\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq Node number \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4Nodenumber\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4r,u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq r,u,v \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4r,u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\n\nSample Input:\n5 3\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n1 5 3\n2 5 3\n4 5 3\n\nSample Output:\n2 1\n1 2\n1 2\n\nEXPLANATION:\nWhen tree is rooted at 1, it looks like\n             1\n\n            / \\\n\n          2   3\n\n        /  \\\n\n      4     5\n\nSo the common point with minimum cost for node 5 and node 3 is node 1, so cost for person at node 5 is 2 and cost for person at node 3 is 1.\nWhen tree is rooted at 4, it looks like\n                     4\n\n                    |\n\n                    2\n\n               /         \\\n\n        5                   1\n   \n                                  \\\n\n                                       3\n\nSo the common point with minimum cost for node 5 and node 3 is node 2, so cost for person at node 5 is 1 and cost for person at node 3 is 2.'
