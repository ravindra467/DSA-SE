b"Problem\nChef like to play with bits,so he was recently gifted with a puzzle book on bits arithmatic by one of his friend on his birthday.\nChef couldn't solve any of the puzzles from the book and needs your help to solve one.\nGiven two integers m & n .Find the number of combinations of bit-size 'n' in which there are no 'm' consecutive '1'.\xc2\xa0\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nEach test consist of single line containing two integers m and n.\nOutput\n\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the number of combinations of bit size n in which no m consecutive 1's occur.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4T \xe2\x89\xa4 50\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 50\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 m \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n2 2\n2 3\nOutput:\n3\n5\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. The 2-bit combinations which satisfy our problem statement are 00 01 10. \nExample case 2. The 3-bit combinations which satisfy our problem statement are 000 001 010 100 101.\n "
