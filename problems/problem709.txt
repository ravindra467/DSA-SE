b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef wants to take Chefina on a date. However, he has to complete one more task before leaving. Since he does not want to be late, he is asking you for help.\nThere are NNN bags with coins in a row (numbered 111 through NNN); for each valid iii, the iii-th bag contains AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b coins. Chef should make the number of coins in each bag divisible by a given integer KKK in the following way:\n\nchoose an integer ccc between 000 and NNN (inclusive)\ntake some coins from the first ccc bags \xe2\x80\x95 formally, for each iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4c1 \\le i \\le c1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4c), he may choose any number of coins between 000 and AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b inclusive and take them out of the iii-th bag\nmove some of these coins to some of the last N\xe2\x88\x92cN-cN\xe2\x88\x92c bags \xe2\x80\x95 formally, for each iii (c+1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4Nc+1 \\le i \\le Nc+1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), he may place a non-negative number of coins in the iii-th bag\n\nOf course, the number of coins placed in the last N\xe2\x88\x92cN-cN\xe2\x88\x92c bags must not exceed the number of coins taken out from the first ccc bags, but there may be some coins left over. Let's denote the number of these coins by RRR. You should find the smallest possible value of RRR.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers NNN and KKK.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the smallest value of RRR.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\le T \\le 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le N \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41090 \\le A_i \\le 10^90\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid iii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\le K \\le 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4109\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 10510^5105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): K=2K = 2K=2\nSubtask #2 (20 points): N\xe2\x89\xa43N \\le 3N\xe2\x89\xa43\nSubtask #3 (70 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n5 7\n1 14 4 41 1\n3 9\n1 10 195\n3\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: One of the possible solutions is to choose c=4c = 4c=4, remove 111, 000, 444 and 131313 coins from bags 111, 222, 333 and 444 respectively, and add 131313 coins to bag 555.\nExample case 2: The optimal solution is to choose c=3c = 3c=3 and remove one coin from each bag."
