b"Problem\nChef recorded a video explaining his favorite recipe. However, the size of the video is too large to upload on the internet. He wants to compress the video so that it has the minimum size possible.\nChef's video has NNN frames initially. The value of the ithi^{th}ith frame is AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b. Chef can do the following type of operation any number of times:\n\nChoose an index iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N)(1\\le i \\le N)(1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N) such that the value of the ithi^{th}ith frame is equal to the value of either of its neighbors and remove the ithi^{th}ith frame.\n\nFind the minimum number of frames Chef can achieve.\nInput Format\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN - the number of frames initially.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers, A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b - the values of the frames.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output in a single line the minimum number of frames Chef can achieve.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq T \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4106\nSum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052\\cdot 10^52\xe2\x8b\x85105.\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4\n1\n5\n2\n1 1\n3\n1 2 3\n4\n2 1 2 2\n1\n1\n3\n3\nExplanation:\nTest case 111: There is only one frame with value 555. Since there are no neighbors, Chef won't remove any frame and the minimum number of frames Chef can achieve is 111.\nTest case 222: There are two frames where both frames have value 111. Chef can remove the first frame as the value of the first frame is equal to that of the second frame. The remaining frames have values [1][1][1]. The minimum number of frames Chef can achieve is 111.\nTest case 333: There are 333 frames. All frames have distinct values. Thus, the minimum number of frames Chef can achieve is 333.\nTest case 444: Chef can remove the fourth frame as the value of the fourth frame is equal to that of the third frame. The remaining frames have values [2,1,2][2, 1, 2][2,1,2]. Thus, the minimum number of frames Chef can achieve is 333."
