b'Problem\nChef\'s friend Rahul gave him a piece of paper. On this paper there are few strings(string A) and beside each string another string(String B) is given. Chef needs to find whether he can convert string A to string B after zero or more deletions. But there is  a condition chef can delete either the first or the last character. Chef is busy and so he needs your help.  ### Input:\nt: Number of test cases\nsa: String A\nsb: String B  ### Output:\nPrint \'YES\' if  String A can be converted to String B otherwise print \'NO\'  ### Constraints:\n1<=t<=1000\n1<=length(sa),length(sb)<=20  ### Sample Input:\n2\nabcdefgh\ncde\nhello\nhey  ### Sample Output:\nYES\nNO  ### Explanation:\nIn the first test case we can convert "abcdefgh" into "cde" by deleting a,b,f,g and h.\nIn the second test case we cannot convert "hello" to "hey"'
