They grew up with each other, and often help each other with competitive programming.\n\n\tChef is participating in a programming contest prepared by Fehc and finds the following problem in Fehc's problem set: given a string s[1..N], count the number of pairs of indices 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 j \xe2\x89\xa4 N such that s[i..j] is palindrome and j-i is even. The characters that may appear in s are 0, 1, 2, ..., 109.\n\n\tChef doesn't know the solution, but he knows Fehc's habits of creating test data. When preparing data for a string problem, Fehc always generates a string of N 0's, and replaces some of the 0's by other characters. Thus, Chef assumes that there are only K nonzero characters in s, and K is usually much smaller than N.\n\n\tGiven this useful information, can you help Chef solve this problem?\n\n\tInput\n\nThe first line of input contains one integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nFor each test case, the first line contains two space-separated integers N and K.\nK lines follow; the i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers pi and qi, meaning that the i-th nonzero character is s[pi] = qi.\n\n\n\tOutput\n\n\tFor each test case, output one integer denoting the answer to the problem.\n\n\tConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 p1 < p2 < ... < pK \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 qi \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\n\n\tSubtask #1 (9 points):\n\nN \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n\n\n\tSubtask #2 (14 points):\n\nN \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n\n\n\tSubtask #3 (21 points):\n\nK \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n\n\n\tSubtask #4 (56 points):\n\noriginal constraints\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n7 2\n5 1\n6 1\n7 3\n2 1\n4 2\n6 1\n10 09\n12\n30\nExplanation:\n\nExample case 1: s={0,0,0,0,1,1,0}.
