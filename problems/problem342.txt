b"Problem\nRead problems statements in Hindi,\nMandarin chinese\n, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nThere are NNN dragons in Wonderland (numbered 111 through NNN). Each dragon lives in one of NNN caves, which are located in a single row and numbered 111 through NNN in the order from left to right. Let's denote the strength of the iii-th dragon by SiS_iSi\xe2\x80\x8b.\nAlso, a beautiful princess lives in Wonderland. Many princes would like to marry her. But the princess feels self-sufficient, so she doesn't want to get married. She loves living in dragon caves and talking to dragons.\nOne day, the princess heard that a new prince is travelling to Wonderland to propose to her. She doesn't want to even see the prince \xe2\x80\x94 instead, she's going to choose some cave to live in and assign exactly one dragon to each cave to protect her from the prince.\nLet's denote the cave the princess chose by FFF and the strength of the dragon inhabiting the iii-th cave after the princess assigns the dragons to caves by XiX_iXi\xe2\x80\x8b. The prince will start his journey near some cave VVV and move straight towards cave FFF, fighting the dragons in all caves between VVV and FFF (both inclusive). The prince initially has strength PPP; by defeating a dragon with strength XXX, the prince's strength decreases by XXX. If the prince's strength becomes non-positive at any time, he dies.\nThe princess does not know the cave the prince will choose to start from. Therefore, she wants to assign the dragons to caves in such a way that the number of caves the prince can start from and die while going to the princess (possibly after defeating all dragons) is maximum possible. Help the princess calculate this number for each possible choice of her cave FFF.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and PPP denoting the number of dragons and the strength of the prince.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers S1,S2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SNS_1, S_2, \\dots, S_NS1\xe2\x80\x8b,S2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,SN\xe2\x80\x8b denoting the strengths of the dragons.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing NNN space-separated integers. For each valid iii, the iii-th of these integers should denote the number of starting caves for the prince such that the prince dies if the princess stays in the iii-th cave.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\le T \\le 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le N \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4P\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le P \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4P\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Si\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le S_i \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4Si\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4105 for each valid iii\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): N\xe2\x89\xa48N \\le 8N\xe2\x89\xa48\nSubtask #2 (10 points): N\xe2\x89\xa420N \\le 20N\xe2\x89\xa420\nSubtask #3 (20 points):\n\nN,P\xe2\x89\xa42,000N, P \\leq 2,000N,P\xe2\x89\xa42,000\nSi\xe2\x89\xa42,000S_i \\leq 2,000Si\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa42,000 for each valid iii\n\nSubtask #4 (20 points):\n\nN,P\xe2\x89\xa420,000N, P \\leq 20,000N,P\xe2\x89\xa420,000\nSi\xe2\x89\xa420,000S_i \\leq 20,000Si\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa420,000 for each valid iii\n\nSubtask #5 (40 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n3 4\n2 1 2\n4 5\n1 1 1 12 1 2\n0 0 0 0\nExplanation:\nExample case 1:\n\nIf F=1F = 1F=1, the optimal sequence XXX is [2,2,1][2, 2, 1][2,2,1]. Then, if the prince starts at the second or third cave, he will die while going to the princess, so the answer is 2.\nIf F=2F = 2F=2, the optimal sequence XXX is again [2,2,1][2, 2, 1][2,2,1]; the prince will die if he starts near the first cave.\nIf F=3F = 3F=3, the optimal sequence XXX is [1,2,2][1, 2, 2][1,2,2]; the prince will die if he starts near the first or second cave.\n\nOn the contrary, if X=[2,1,2]X = [2, 1, 2]X=[2,1,2] for F=2F = 2F=2, the prince would be able to reach the princess starting from any cave, so this is not an optimal assignment of dragons."
