b"Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\n\nThere's an array A consisting of N non-zero integers A1..N. A subarray of A is called alternating if any two adjacent elements in it have different signs (i.e. one of them should be negative and the other should be positive).\n\nFor each x from 1 to N, compute the length of the longest alternating subarray that starts at x - that is, a subarray Ax..y for the maximum possible y \xe2\x89\xa5 x. The length of such a subarray is y-x+1.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T - the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains N.\nThe following line contains N space-separated integers A1..N.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output one line with N space-separated integers - the lengths of the longest alternating subarray starting at x, for each x from 1 to N.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n-109 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n4\n1 2 3 4\n4\n1 -5 1 -5\n6\n-5 -1 -1 2 -2 -31 1 1 1\n4 3 2 1\n1 1 3 2 1 1\nExplanation:\nExample case 1. No two elements have different signs, so any alternating subarray may only consist of a single number.\nExample case 2. Every subarray is alternating.\nExample case 3. The only alternating subarray of length 3 is A3..5."
