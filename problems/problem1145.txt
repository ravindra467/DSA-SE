b'Problem\nA machine recycles scrap bottles, the size of the bottle is categorised into types. For nnn number of bottles you have to calculate the number of bottles in each category type.\nSize to category table:-\nBOTTLE SIZE: \t |    1,2\t -      TYPE 1\r\n|    3,4       -      TYPE 2\r\n|    5,6       -      TYPE 3\nInput:\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T. T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases is as follows.\nThe first line of each testcase will contain the total number of bottles NNN . The next line will contain the size of each bottle separated by a space.\n\nOutput:\n\nFor each test case, print "TYPE # - 5". where # denotes the type of bottle and 5 denotes the total count of it.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq T \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4SizeOfBottle\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\leq Size Of Bottle \\leq 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4SizeOfBottle\xe2\x89\xa4106\n\nSample Input:\n1\r\n11\r\n1 1 2 3 4 5 3 6 2 3 1 \n\nSample Output:\nTYPE 1 - 5\r\nTYPE 2 - 4\r\nTYPE 3 - 2\n\nExplanation:\nThe first line of input is the number of testcases which in this case is 1.\r\nThe second line of input is the number of bottles which in this case is 11.\r\nThe third line of input is the size of each bottle.\nOn comparing the size of the bottles which in this case are 1 1 2 3 4 5 3 6 2 3 1 we can see that\nTYPE 1 has 5 bottles (i.e 1 1 2 2 1)\r\nTYPE 2 has 4 bottles (i.e 3 4 3 3)\r\nTYPE 3 has 2 bottles (i.e 5 6)'
