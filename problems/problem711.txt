b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Bengali as well.\nThere are nnn chocolates, and you are given an array of nnn numbers where the iii-th number AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b is the flavour type of the iii-th chocolate. Sebrina wants to eat as many different types of chocolates as possible, but she also has to save at least xxx number of chocolates for her little brother.\nFind the maximum possible number of distinct flavour types Sebrina can have.\nInput:\nThe first line contains an integer TTT --- the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case consists of two integers nnn, xxx - The number of chocolates Sabrina has and the number of chocolates she has to save for her brother, respectively.\nThe second line contains nnn integers A1,\xe2\x80\xa6,AnA_1,\\ldots, A_nA1\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,An\xe2\x80\x8b, where the iii-th chocolate has type AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b.\nOutput:\nFor each test case, output a single integer denoting the maximum possible number of distinct chocolate flavours Sabrina can eat.\nConstraints\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101\\le T\\le 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051 \\le x \\le  n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5  1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\le A_{i} \\le 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\nSum of nnn over all test cases do not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052 \\cdot 10^5 2\xe2\x8b\x85105\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n2 1\n1 2\n4 2\n1 1 1 1\n5 3\n50 50 50 100 1001\n1\n2\nExplanation:\nTest case 111: In the first case, the maximum number of chocolates Sebrina can have is 111 as she has to leave 111 chocolate for her brother. Thus, the maximum number of distinct chocolates is also 111.\nTest case 222: Sebrina has to leave 222 chocolates for her brother. She can eat any 222 chocolates. Since all the chocolates have the same flavor, it does not matter which chocolates she eats. The maximum number of distinct chocolates would be 111.\nTest case 333: Sebrina needs to save 333 chocolates for her brother. She can eat any 222 chocolates. To maximize the number of distinct chocolates, she can eat chocolates 111 and 555 with flavors 505050 and 100100100 respectively. Thus maximum number of distinct chocolates is 222.'
