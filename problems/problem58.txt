b'Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nLittle Elephant from Zoo of Lviv likes to paint.\nHe has n objects to paint, ordered in a row and numbered form left to right starting from 1. There are totally c colors, numbered from 0 to c-1. At the beggining all objects are colored in color with number 1. When object with color a is painted in color b, the resulting color will have number (a*b) mod c.\nLittle Elephant is going to make k turns. At i-th (0-based numeration) turn he will randomly choose any subset (even empty) of objects with indices in range [Li; Ri] (inclusive) and paint all objects in chosen subset with random color (the same for all objects in the subset).\nLittle Elephant wants to know the expected sum of all colors over all n objects after making all k turns. Help him.\nInput\nFirst line contain single integer T - the number of test cases. T test cases follow. First line of each test case contains three integers n, c and k. Next k lines of each test case contain k pairs of integers Li and Ri, one pair per line.\nOutput\nIn T lines print T real numbers - the answers for the corresponding test cases.\nAny results within 10^-6 absolute error will be accepted.\nConstraints\n\n1 <= T <= 10\n\n1 <= n, k <= 50\n\n2 <= c <= 100\n\n1 <= Li <= Ri <= n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n4 3 4\n1 2\n2 4\n3 3\n1 4\n7 10 7\n7 7\n3 4\n1 2\n5 5\n4 5\n2 7\n3 33.444444444\n22.943125000'
