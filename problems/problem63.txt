b'Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\n\nLast week Penguin Charlie had a birthday. Chef presented him a string S.\n\n\nUnfortunately, Charlie doesn\'t like string S, he likes string F. Charlie wants to create a few strings F from S by cutting. Cutting means getting some substrings from S that are equal to F and delete them from string S. After deleting a substring, the left and right parts of the resulting string remain separated. Note, a substring of a string S is a consecutive sequence of characters in S.\n\n\nIn some cases Charlie can still get substrings equal to F from the pieces that remain after cutting the original string. Your task is to calculate the number of ways to cut out at least one occurrence of the substring F in S. As this number may be too large, print it modulo 109\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x897.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\n\nInput begins with an integer T: the number of test cases.\nEach test case consists of a two lines with two strings: S, F.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line indicating the number of ways Charlie can cut at least one occurrence of F from S modulo 109\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x897.\n\nConstraints and Subtasks\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10 \nSubtask 1 : 10 points \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 |F| \xe2\x89\xa4 |S| \xe2\x89\xa4 100\nSubtask 2 : 30 points \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 |F| \xe2\x89\xa4 |S| \xe2\x89\xa4 5000\nSubtask 3 : 60 points\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 |F| \xe2\x89\xa4 |S| \xe2\x89\xa4 300000\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\nchefandcharliethebest\ncharliethebest\nheknowsimeanityeahyouknowimeanityouknow\nimeanit\naaaaa\naa1\n3\n7\nExplanation:\n\nExample case 1.\nchefand|charliethebest|\n1 way to cut 1 string "charliethebest" from the string S:Example case 2.\nheknows|imeanit|yeahyouknow|imeanit|youknow\n2 ways to cut 1 string "imeanit" from the string S - take one of them\n1 way to cut 2 strings "imeanit" from the string S - take both:Example case 3.\n4 ways to cut 1 string "aa" from the string "aaaaa": |aa|aaa, a|aa|aa, aa|aa|a, aaa|aa|\n3 ways to cut 2 strings "aa" from the string "aaaaa": |aa||aa|a, |aa|a|aa|, a|aa||aa|.'
