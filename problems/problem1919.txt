b'Problem\nSatkkeerthi has decided to participate in the Game of Stones. There are nnn cities numbered 111 to nnn and mmm directeddirecteddirected\nroadsroadsroads between the cities.\nThere is an infinitely large pile of stones in each city, of one particular colour. Each colour is described by a colour code, ai at the ith city.\nA player must choose a path starting from one city, and at every city along the path, he/she adds one stone to the collection at hand. The score of a player is defined as the maximum number of stones collected of aaa particularparticularparticular colourcolourcolour. Help Satkkeerthi maximize his score and be declared the bearer of an aptronym!\nInput:\nThe first line of input contains two integers nnn,mmm,the number of cities and the number of roads connecting them, respectively.\nThe second line contains nnn integers separated by a space, ai denoting the colourcolourcolour codecodecode of the stone at city i.\nThen mmm lines follow, where each line contains two integers xxx and yyy, indicating that there is a directeddirecteddirected road from city xxx to city yyy. We remind you that xxx and yyy may be equal, and do notnotnot guarantee complete connectivity of all cities.\nOutput:\nPrint a single integer, the maximum score which Satkkerthi can achieve. If his score can be arbitrarily large, print -1.\nConstraints:\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq n,m \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4colourcode\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq colourcode \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4colourcode\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4n1 \\leq x,y \\leq n1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4n\n\nSample input:\n 5 6\n 1 2 1 2 2\n 1 2\n 1 3\n 1 4\n 2 3\n 4 5\n 5 2\n\nSample Output:\n   3\n\nExplanation:\nThe path 4----2-----5 contains 3 stones of colour 2 and is thus the maximum score that can be obtained.'
