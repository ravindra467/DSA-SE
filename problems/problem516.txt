b'Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a convex polygon consisting of n vertices in 2-D plane. You are also given m points, each colored in either red or blue.\nA convex polygon is called w00t, if the number of red and blue colored points inside this (inside or on the boundary) are equal.\nYou want to find number of w00t convex polygons whose vertices are a subset of the vertices of the given convex polygon.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of the test cases.\nThe first line of each test case will contain two space separated integers n, m denoting the number of points on the convex polygon, and number of the colored points, respectively.\nIn the next n lines, each line contains two space separated integers x, y denoting the x and y coordinates of the points of convex polygon. The points of the convex polygon are given to you in anticlockwise order. It is guaranteed that no three points on the convex polygon are collinear.\nIn the next m lines, each line contains three space separated integers x, y, c, where x, y denotes the x and y coordinates of the colored points, and c denotes the color of the point. If c = 0, the point is red colored, where if c = 1, point is blue colored..\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single integer corresponding to the number of w00t convex polygons whose vertices are subset of the given convex polygon.\nConstraints \n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 20\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n, m \xe2\x89\xa4 50\nn \xe2\x89\xa5 3\n-106 \xe2\x89\xa4 |xi, yi| \xe2\x89\xa4 -106\nIn the given m points, two or more points might coincide.\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1: (15 points)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n, m \xe2\x89\xa4 12\n\n\n\nSubtask #2: (20 points)\n\nEach of the m points has same coordinates as that of some vertices of the convex polygon.\nAll the colored points have different coordinates.\n\n\n\nSubtask #3: (25 points)\n\nEach of the m points has same coordinates as that of some vertices of the convex polygon.\n\n\n\nSubtask #4: (40 points)\n\nOriginal Constraints\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n4 4\n0 0\n1 0\n1 1\n0 1\n0 0 0\n1 0 1\n1 1 0\n0 1 1\n6 6\n-1 1\n0 0\n1 0\n2 1\n1 2\n0 2\n-1 1 0\n0 0 1\n1 0 0\n2 1 1\n1 2 0 \n0 2 11\n10\nExplanation:\nExample case 1.
