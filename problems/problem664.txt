b'Problem\n\nGiven an integer, N.  Convert this integer to binary and then if the Kth bit is not set then set the Kth bit otherwise leave it as it is. Then convert this binary to decimal M.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two space seperated integer N and K \n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the new number M\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105 \n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105 \n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 31\nAll values are unsigned integer type \n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n2 0\n5 0\nOutput:\n3\n5\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1.N = 2 which can be represented by 10 in binary, now if we set 0th bit then it becomes 11 which is equal to 3 in decimal'
