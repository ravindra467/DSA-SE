b"Problem\nRead problems statements Mandarin , Bengali , Hindi , Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nThere are NNN buckets numbered 111 through NNN. The buckets contain balls; each ball has a color between 111 and KKK. Let's denote the number of balls with color jjj that are initially in bucket iii by ai,ja_{i, j}ai,j\xe2\x80\x8b.\nFor each iii from 111 to N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 (in this order), someone draws a ball uniformly at random from bucket iii and puts it into bucket i+1i+1i+1, then continues to draw the next ball. After putting a ball in bucket NNN, this person draws a ball, again uniformly at random, from bucket NNN.\nFor each color from 111 to KKK, find the probability that the ball drawn from bucket NNN has this color.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers NNN and KKK.\nNNN lines follow. For each iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le i \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the iii-th of these lines contains KKK space-separated integers ai,1,ai,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ai,Ka_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, \\ldots, a_{i, K}ai,1\xe2\x80\x8b,ai,2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,ai,K\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nPrint a single line containing KKK space-separated real numbers. For each valid iii, the iii-th of these numbers should denote the probability that the last drawn ball has color iii. your answer will be considered correct if absolute or relative error does not exceed 10\xe2\x88\x92610^{-6}10\xe2\x88\x926\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le N, K \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4ai,j\xe2\x89\xa4100 \\le a_{i, j} \\le 100\xe2\x89\xa4ai,j\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa410 for each valid i,ji, ji,j\ninitially, there is at least one ball in bucket 111\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le N, K \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4N,K\xe2\x89\xa4100\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2 2\n0 1\n1 10.333333 0.666667"
