b'Problem\nThere is going to be a major fair in Government College Of Engineering Nagpur \xe2\x80\x93 GCOEN  Named as Adhyaaya . In which there are many events going to happen. There are nnn numbers of events you can attend. You know its starting and ending days and the amount of money you could win in the event.But the condition is that you can attend only one event in a day. Tell the maximum amount of money you will win.\nInput Format\n\nThe first input line contains an integer nnn: the number of events.\nAfter this, there are n lines. Each such line has three integers aaa,bbb, and mmm: the starting day, the ending day, and the money .\n\nOutput Format\n\nPrint one integer: the maximum amount of money you can earn.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 2\xe2\x88\x97105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 a \xe2\x89\xa4 b \xe2\x89\xa4109\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 m \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\n\nSubtasks\n\n\n100 points : All Constraints\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4\n2 4 4\n3 6 6\n6 8 2\n5 7 3\n7\nExplanation:\nIn the given test case, There are 4 events in which you can participate \n\nfirst event will start on day 2 and end on day 4 \nsecond event will start on day 3 and end on day 6 \nThird event will start on day 6 and end on day 8 \nFourth event will start on day 5 and end on day 7 \nSo, first event and third , first event and fourth event are the only 2 events whose days are not co-inciding. [2,4] && [6,8] and [2,4] && [5,7] respectively.  \nif we add prizes of 2 events , we will get prize of (4+2 = 6) in first condition and (4+3 =7) in second condition, so we will print max of them i.e 7.\n'
