b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian.\nNobody knows, but NNN frogs live in Chef\'s garden.\nNow they are siting on the X-axis and want to speak to each other. One frog can send a message to another one if the distance between them is less or equal to KKK.\nChef knows all PPP pairs of frogs, which want to send messages. Help him to define can they or not!\nNote : More than 111 frog can be on the same point on the X-axis.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains three integers NNN, KKK and PPP.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers A1A_1A1\xe2\x80\x8b, A2A_2A2\xe2\x80\x8b, ..., ANA_NAN\xe2\x80\x8b denoting the x-coordinates of frogs".\nEach of the next PPP lines contains two integers AAA and BBB denoting the numbers of frogs according to the input.\n\nOutput\nFor each pair print "Yes" without a brackets if frogs can speak and "No" if they cannot.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,P\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le N, P \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N,P\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,K\xe2\x89\xa41090 \\le A_i, K \\le 10^90\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b,K\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A,B\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le A, B \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4A,B\xe2\x89\xa4N\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput5 3 3\n0 3 8 5 12\n1 2\n1 3\n2 5Yes\nYes\nNo\nExplanation:\n\n\nFor pair (1,2)(1, 2)(1,2) frog 111 can directly speak to the frog 222 as the distance between them is 3\xe2\x88\x920=3\xe2\x89\xa4K3 - 0 = 3 \\le K3\xe2\x88\x920=3\xe2\x89\xa4K .\n\n\nFor pair (1,3)(1, 3)(1,3) frog 111 can send a message to frog 222, frog 222 can send it to frog 444 and it can send it to frog 333.\n\n\nFor pair (2,5)(2, 5)(2,5) frogs can\'t send a message under current constraints.\n\n'
