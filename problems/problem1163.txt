b'Problem\n\nAbhishek was given a task by his teacher to find whether the two strings are\ncompanion strings or not.\n\n\nTwo strings s1 and s2 are said to be companion strings if the number of distinct substrings of s1 and number of distinct substrings of s2 are equal. Also s1 and s2 need not to be of equal length.\n\nGiven two strings s1 and s2, print \xe2\x80\x9cCompanion\xe2\x80\x9d if s1 and s2 are companion strings, else print \xe2\x80\x9cNon Companion\xe2\x80\x9d.\nInput:\n\n1st line contain string s1\n2nd line contain string s2\n\nOutput:\n\nCompanion OR Non Companion\n\nConstraints: \n\n1<=Length of string s1<=100\n1<=Length of string s2<=100\n\nSample Input:\n\t \nabca\npqpqp\n\nSample Output:\n\nCompanion\n\nExplanation:\n\nabca has 9 distinct substrings a, b, c, ab, bc, ca, abc, bca, abca.\npqpqp also has 9 distinct substrings p, q, pq, qp, pqp, qpq, pqpq, qpqp, pqpqp. So they are companion strings.\n'
