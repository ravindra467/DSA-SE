b'Problem\nRead problem statement in Mandarin chinese and Vietnamese.\nTweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum are playing a fierce match of binary Nim. This novel game is played with NNN stacks, each of them containing only 111-s and 000-s.\nJust like in normal Nim, Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum alternate turns; in their turn, a player must choose one non-empty stack and remove a positive number of elements from the top of this stack. However, Tweedle-Dee may only choose a stack with 000 at the top (and remove elements from it afterwards), and similarly, Tweedle-Dum may only choose a stack with 111 at the top. the player that cannot make a move loses\nSuzumo does not want to wait for the end of the game, so given the starting player he asks you to determine the winner. Remember that Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum are legendary grandmasters of combinatorial games, so both always play optimally.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer NNN, a string SSS denoting the number of stacks, the player that starts the game, respectively.\nEach of the following NNN lines contains a single binary string BBB representing a stack; the first character of BBB corresponds to the top element of the stack and the last character to the bottom element.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "Dee" if Tweedle-Dee wins the match or "Dum" if Tweedle-Dum wins.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45001 \\le T \\le 5001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4500\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4501 \\le N \\le 501\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa450\n1\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3B\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4501 \\le |B| \\le 501\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3B\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa450\neach character in BBB is either \'1\' or \'0\'\nSSS is either "Dee" or "Dum"\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n2 Dee\n101\n010\n2 Dum\n101\n010Dum\nDee'
