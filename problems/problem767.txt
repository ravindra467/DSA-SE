He noticed that there are exactly N cooked doughnuts in the kitchen, some of which are already connected in chains. The only thing he needs to do is connect them in one chain.\nHe can cut one doughnut (from any position in a chain) into two halves and then use this cut doughnut to link two different chains.\nHelp Chef determine the minimum number of cuts needed to complete the order.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integer N and M denoting the size of order and number of cooked chains respectively.\nThe second line contains M space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AM denoting the size of the chains.\n\nIt is guaranteed that N is equal to the sum of all Ai\'s over 1<=i<=M.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the number of cuts needed Chef to make the order.\nConstraints and Subtasks\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 200\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 2*109\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n\nSubtask 1: 10 points\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 2*104\nAi = 1\n\nSubtask 2: 30 points\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n\nSubtask 3: 60 points\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 M \xe2\x89\xa4 2*104\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n11 3\n4 3 4\n6 3\n3 2 12\n1\nExplanation:\nExample 1: We could cut 2 doughnut from any "chain" and use them to connect chains to the one.  For example, let\'s cut it from the first chain. After this we will have chains of sizes 2, 3, 4 and two doughnuts that have been cut. So we could connect the first chain with second and second with third using these two doughnuts.\nExample 2: We cut doughnut from the last "chain" and connect the first two chains.\n\nImage for second example. Yellow doughnut has been cut.'
