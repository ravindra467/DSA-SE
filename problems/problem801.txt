b"Problem\nInitially, Alice and Bob both have a bag of NNN stones each with every stone having a lowercase alphabet written on it. Both players know the stones of the other player.\nAlice and Bob want to create a string SSS of length 2\xe2\x8b\x85N2 \\cdot N2\xe2\x8b\x85N using the stones they have. They play a game to create the string. The rules of the game are as follows:\n\nInitially, all the indices of SSS are empty.\nAlice starts the game. The players take alternating turns. In each turn, the player can choose one of the stones from their bag and place it at any empty index iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85N)(1 \\le i \\le 2 \\cdot N)(1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85N) of SSS.\nThe game ends when both the players have used all their stones.\nAlice wants SSS to be as lexicographically small as possible while Bob wants SSS to be as lexicographically large as possible.\n\nFind the final string SSS formed by characters written on stones if both Alice and Bob play optimally!\nNote: A string XXX is lexicographically smaller than a string YYY if and only if one of the following holds:\n\nXXX is a prefix of YYY and X\xe2\x89\xa0YX \\ne YX\xee\x80\xa0=Y\nIn the first position where XXX and YYY differ, the string XXX has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in YYY.\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains an integer TTT - the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows:\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer NNN - the number of stones each player has.\nThe second line of each test case contains a string AAA of length NNN describing the stones in Alice's bag initially.\nThe third line of each test case contains a string BBB of length NNN describing the stones in Bob's bag initially.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print the final string SSS formed if Alice and Bob play optimally.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq T \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052 \\cdot 10^52\xe2\x8b\x85105.\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n3\naza\nabz\n4\ncccc\nccccazabza\ncccccccc\nExplanation:\nTest case-1: Initially Alice's stones are aza , while Bob's stones are abz. Initially SSS is _ _ _ _ _ _.\n\n\nAlice's turn\nAlice puts stone a at index i=1i = 1i=1.\nString SSS: a _ _ _ _ _\nAlice's stones: [za]\nBob's stones: [abz]\n\n\nBob's turn\nBob puts stone z at index i=2i = 2i=2.\nString SSS: a z _ _ _ _\nAlice's stones: [za]\nBob's stones: [ab]\n\n\nAlice's turn\nAlice puts stone a at index i=3i = 3i=3.\nString SSS: a z a _ _ _\nAlice's stones: [z]\nBob's stones: [ab]\n\n\nBob's turn\nBob puts stone a at index i=6i = 6i=6.\nString SSS: a z a _ _ a\nAlice's stones: [z]\nBob's stones: [b]\n\n\nAlice's turn\nAlice puts stone z at index i=5i = 5i=5.\nString SSS: a z a _ z a\nAlice's stones: []\nBob's stones: [b]\n\n\nBob's turn\nBob puts stone b at index i=4i = 4i=4.\nString SSS: a z a b z a\nAlice's stones: []\nBob's stones: []\n\n\nSince both the players have used all their stones, the game ends.\nSo the final string SSS is azabza."
