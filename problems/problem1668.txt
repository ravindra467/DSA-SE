b"Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef is working with lines on a 2-D plane.\nHe knows that every line on a plane can be clearly defined by three coefficients A, B and C: any point (x,\xc2\xa0y) lies on the line if and only if A * x + B * y + C = 0.\nLet's call a set of lines to be perfect if there does not exist a point that belongs to two or more distinct lines of the set.\nHe has a set of lines on a plane and he wants to find out the size of the largest perfect subset of this set.\nInput\nThe first line of input contains one integers T denoting the number of test cases.\nEach test case consists of one integer N denoting number of lines.\nNext N lines contain 3 space-separated integers each denoting coefficients A, B and C respectively.\nOutput\nFor each test case output the cardinality of the largest perfect subset in a single line.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 Nmax\nSum over all N for all test cases \xe2\x89\xa4 NSmax\n|A|, |B|, |C| \xe2\x89\xa4 109\nFor a line with coefficients A, B and C either A or B is not zero.\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 [35 points]: Nmax = 5000, NSmax = 50000\nSubtask #2 [65 points]: Nmax = NSmax = 105\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n5\n1 0 0\n1 2 3\n3 4 5\n30 40 0\n30 40 502\nExplanation:\nLines 3*x + 4*y + 5 = 0 and 30*x + 40*y + 0 = 0 form a biggest perfect subset."
