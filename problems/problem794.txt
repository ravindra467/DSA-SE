b"Problem\nYou're given a sequence of NNN distinct integers. You need to find a subsequence of length KKK with the maximum possible median.\nThe median of a sequence is the value of the element which is in the middle of the sequence after sorting it in non-decreasing order. If the length of the sequence is even, the left of two middle elements is selected. For example, if the sequence is [3,4,2,1,5][3, 4, 2, 1, 5][3,4,2,1,5], then the median is 333 since after sorting, it will look like [1,2,3,4,5][1, 2, 3, 4, 5][1,2,3,4,5] and 333 is the only middle element. The median of [4,2,1,5][4, 2, 1, 5][4,2,1,5] is 222 since after sorting, the value 222 is the left of the two middle elements 222 and 444.\nA subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, if the sequence is [2,1,4,5,7][2, 1, 4, 5, 7][2,1,4,5,7], then [1,5,7][1, 5, 7][1,5,7], [2,1,4][2, 1, 4][2,1,4], [5][5][5] are some valid subsequences but [4,1,2][4, 1, 2][4,1,2], [1,6,7][1, 6, 7][1,6,7] are not.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line will contain TTT, the number of test cases. The description of test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case consists of two space-separated integers NNN, the length of the sequence, and KKK, the length of the subsequence to be found.\nThe second line of each test case consists of NNN distinct space-separated integers AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b, the elements of the sequence.\n\nOutput Format\n\nFor each test case, output two lines.\nThe first line should consist of the median of the subsequence with the maximum median.\nThe second line should consist of KKK space-separated integers, representing a subsequence with that median. If there are multiple such subsequences, print any.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4301 \\leq T \\leq 301\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa430\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xc3\x971051 \\leq K \\leq N \\leq 2 \\times 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xc3\x97105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\nSum of NNN over all test cases won't exceed 5\xc3\x971055 \\times 10^55\xc3\x97105\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n5 3\n1 4 3 6 55\n1 6 5"
