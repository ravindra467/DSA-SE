b"Problem\nThe country of Chefland is a group of NNN cities having MMM directed roads between its cities. It takes 111 second to travel on any road.\nChef has decided to travel through this country. His travel plan goes as follows -\n\nHe will randomly choose a starting city.\nWhile there are outgoing roads in his current city, he will randomly choose one of them and travel it. He can choose roads he has already traveled through and visit cities multiple times.\nHe will stop if there are no outgoing roads in the current city or NNN seconds have passed.\n\nChef will be disappointed if after traveling he does not end up in the capital city.\nThe ministers have not yet decided upon the capital city. They would like to choose it in such a way that Chef is not disappointed by his trip. To make their decision a bit easier, they can build some new roads between cities.\nFind the minimum number of roads that need to be built such that the ministers can choose a capital city that doesn't disappoint Chef no matter where his trip starts or how it progresses.\nIt is possible that the current road system is such that no matter which roads are added, a capital that doesn't disappoint Chef cannot be chosen. In this case, print \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 instead.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line will contain TTT, denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN, denoting the number of cities.\nThe second line of each test case contains a single integer MMM, denoting the number of roads in the city initially.\nThen MMM lines follow each containing two integers AAA and BBB, denoting a road from city AAA to city BBB.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output a single line denoting the minimum number of roads you have to build, or \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 if it is not possible to satisfy the given condition.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851041 \\leq T \\leq 5\\cdot 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x851051 \\leq N \\leq 2\\cdot 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xe2\x8b\x85105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4min\xe2\x81\xa1(N\xe2\x8b\x85(N\xe2\x88\x921),4\xe2\x8b\x85105)0 \\leq M \\leq \\min(N\\cdot (N - 1), 4\\cdot 10^5)0\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4min(N\xe2\x8b\x85(N\xe2\x88\x921),4\xe2\x8b\x85105)\nThe sum of N+MN + MN+M does not exceed 10610^6106 over all testcases\nThe graph has no self loops or duplicate edges\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n3\n2\n1 2\n2 3\n2\n2\n1 2\n2 1\n0\n-1\nExplanation:\nTest case 111: No matter where Chef starts, he will end up in city 333, so it can be made the capital city and we do not need to construct any roads.\nTest case 222: No new roads can be constructed. Chef will always end up in whichever city he starts from, so the ministers cannot decide upon a capital \xe2\x80\x94 choosing city 111 as the capital would disappoint Chef if his trip started from city 222 and vice versa."
