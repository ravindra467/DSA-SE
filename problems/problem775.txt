b"Problem\nYou are given a binary string SSS of length NNN (i.e. every character of SSS is either 000 or 111).\nYou can perform the following operation on SSS:\n\nselect any two indices i,ji, ji,j of the same parity, i.e. either both i,ji, ji,j are odd or both i,ji, ji,j are even\nswap SiS_iSi\xe2\x80\x8b and SjS_jSj\xe2\x80\x8b\n\nFor example, in the string 111011101110, we can swap the second and the fourth characters to get 101110111011. However, we can never obtain 110111011101 from 111011101110 by performing such swaps.\nFind the maximum possible number of occurrences of the string 010101 as a substring of SSS after performing the above operation any number of times (it is also allowed to not perform any operation).\nFor example, the string 111011101110 has no occurrence of the string 010101 as a substring, whereas we can swap the second and fourth characters to obtain 10111{\\color{red}{01}}11011 which has exactly one occurrence of 010101 (colored red).\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains an integer TTT, denoting the number of testcases. The description of the TTT testcases follow.\nEach testcase consists of two lines.\nThe first line contains a single integer NNN, the length of the string SSS.\nThe second line contains a binary string of length NNN.\n\nOutput Format\n\nFor each testcase, print in a single line, an integer \xe2\x80\x94 the answer as per the problem statement.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa440001 \\leq T \\leq 40001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa44000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq |S| \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4105\nThe sum of \xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3|S|\xe2\x88\xa3S\xe2\x88\xa3 over all testcases doesn't exceed 10510^5105\n\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 (100 points): Original constraints\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n5\n00100\n5\n01010\n5\n100011\n2\n2\nExplanation:\nTest case 111: The only strings that can be obtained by performing the given operations are {10000,00100,00001}\\{10000, 00100, 00001\\}{10000,00100,00001}.
