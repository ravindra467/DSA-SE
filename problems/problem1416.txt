b"Problem\nRam is trying to fill NNN buckets of water numbered from 111 to NNN.\nEach of these buckets iii  (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq i \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N) have capacity CiC_iCi\xe2\x80\x8b and it needs to be filled with CiC_iCi\xe2\x80\x8b liters of water.\nHe has a special water hose which has a really useful feature. At each turn, when Ram aims this hose at any bucket and presses the hose trigger, this hose will throw XXX liters of water at that bucket which it is aimed at and YYY liters of water at all other N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 buckets. (also it is guaranteed that Y<XY \\lt XY<X)\nNow Ram wonders what is the minimum number of turns in which Ram will be able to fill all buckets with water. (Note: It's okay if water is overflowing in some bucket.)\nSee test case for explanation.\n### Input\n - The first line will have an integer TTT, the number of test cases.\n - The first line of each testcase will have 333 integers NNN , XXX and YYY.\n - Next line will have NNN space separated integers where the ithi_{th}ith\xe2\x80\x8b integer denotes CiC_iCi\xe2\x80\x8b.\n### Output:\n- Print on a single line, the minimum number of turns needed to fill all buckets fully with water.\n### Constraints \n- 1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq T \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n- 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq  N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n- 1\xe2\x89\xa4Ci,X,Y\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq  C_i,X,Y \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Ci\xe2\x80\x8b,X,Y\xe2\x89\xa4109\n- Sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 10510^5105\n### Sample Input:\n\t2\n\t5 4 2\n\t2 2 2 4 2\n\t5 3 2\n\t2 2 4 3 2\n### Sample Output:\n\t1\n\t2\n### Sample Test Explanation:\nFor testcase 1,\nRam can fill all bucket in a single turn. He will just aim hose at 4th bucket and fill it with 4 liter of water. And simultaneously , the remaining 4 buckets will be filled with 2 liters of water. \nFor testcase 2,\nA possible approach to fill in two turns is :\nAim hose at 4th bucket and after that , only the 3rd bucket will be left to fill with 1 liter of water. It can be done in the next step.\nOr\nAnother approach is :\nAim hose at 3rd bucket and after that , both 3rd bucket and 2nd bucket will be left to fill with 1 liter of water each. It can be done in the next step by aiming at any bucket."
