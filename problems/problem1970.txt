b'Problem\nOnce in the Tokyo city Group of Ghouls i.e GoatGoatGoat\xe2\x80\x8b is being hunted by CCG\r\n(police of the Tokyo city)  and now the group is hiding in the  xxx-th division of the city.\r\nThe city contains n divisions which are connected with m bidirectional roads, and Kaneki doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want GoatGoatGoat to get hunted by CCG, whenKaneki comes to know that police from zzz-th division of the city is heading towards the  xxx-th division to catch his group, Kaneki was in yyy-th division of the city. Now \xe2\x80\x9cGoat\xe2\x80\x9d can only be saved from CCG if Kaneki arrives earlier or at the same time when CCG arrives at xxx-th division.It is given that for anyone who wants to move from one division to its adjacent division of the Tokyo city it takes 1 hour.\nTouka, wife of Kaneki is away from the city and she is very nervous about all this so she started to calculate the time and predict the results. You are the only friend of Touka and you need to help her by predicting if Kaneki will be able to save the GoatGoatGoat ?\nIf yes then print \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d else print \xe2\x80\x9cNO\xe2\x80\x9d without a quote.\nInput:\nHere you will be given q queries conatining division in which GoatGoatGoat is hiding will be given for eachquery you have to predict the results\n\nFrst line of input you will be given integers nnn and mmm ,number of divisions in the Tokyo city 1,2,3...n1,2,3...n1,2,3...n and number of bidirectional roads in the city respectively\nNext mmm lines youwill be given an integers u,vu,vu,v indicating that there is a road between division uuu and division vvv.\nOn the next line you will be given integers  yyy and zzz  indicating division of Kaneki and division of CCG respectively.\nAfter this on the next line you will be given an integer  qqq, number of queries.\nNext qqq lines you will be provided by an integer xxx , location  of  \xe2\x80\x9cGoat\xe2\x80\x9d .\n\nOutput:\nFor qqq queries print the result of each query as \xe2\x80\x9cYES\xe2\x80\x9d if Kaneki is able to save GoatGoatGoat from CCG or print \xe2\x80\x9cNO\xe2\x80\x9d if Kaneki is not without quotes on new line.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\leq n,m \\leq 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\leq q \\leq 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4q\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y,z\xe2\x89\xa4n1 \\leq x,y,z \\leq n1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y,z\xe2\x89\xa4n\n\nSample Input:\n6 6\r\n1 2\r\n1 5\r\n2 3\r\n2 4\r\n4 5\r\n4 6\r\n3 5\r\n3\r\n2 \r\n4\r\n6\n\nSample Output:\nYES\r\nNO \r\nNO\n\nEXPLANATION:\nIn the above test case Kaneki is located at division 3 and CCG is located at division 5\nIn 2nd query\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x8bGoat\xe2\x80\x8bGoat\xe2\x80\x8bGoat is located at division 4.\nKaneki will require 2 hrs to reach the group 3\xe2\x88\x92>2\xe2\x88\x92>43->2->43\xe2\x88\x92>2\xe2\x88\x92>4 .\nCCG will require 1hr to reach the group 5\xe2\x88\x92>45->45\xe2\x88\x92>4.\nSo Kaneki will not be able to save the \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bGoat\xe2\x80\x8bGoat\xe2\x80\x8bGoat.\nHence Answer of 2nd query is NO.'
