b"Problem\nMario's bullet moves at XXX pixels per frame. He wishes to shoot a goomba standing YYY pixels away from him. The goomba does not move.\nFind the minimum time (in seconds) after which Mario should shoot the bullet, such that it hits the goomba after at least ZZZ seconds from now.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input will contain an integer TTT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nEach test case consists of a single line of input, containing three space-separated integers X,Y,X, Y,X,Y, and ZZZ.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output in a single line the minimum time (in seconds) after which Mario should shoot the bullet, such that it hits the goomba after at least ZZZ seconds from now.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq T \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X,Y,Z\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq X, Y, Z \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4X,Y,Z\xe2\x89\xa4100\nXXX divides YYY\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n3 3 5\n2 4 1\n3 12 84\n0\n4\nExplanation:\nTest case 111: The speed of the bullet is 333 pixels per frame and the goomba is 333 pixels away from Mario. Thus, it would take 111 second for the bullet to reach the goomba. Mario wants the bullet to reach goomba after at least 555 seconds. So, he should fire the bullet after 444 seconds.\nTest case 222: The speed of the bullet is 222 pixels per frame and the goomba is 444 pixels away from Mario. Thus, it would take 222 seconds for the bullet to reach the goomba. Mario wants the bullet to reach the goomba after at least 111 second. So, he should fire the bullet after 000 seconds. Note that, this is the minimum time after which he can shoot a bullet.\nTest case 333: The speed of the bullet is 333 pixels per frame and the goomba is 121212 pixels away from Mario. Thus, it would take 444 seconds for the bullet to reach the goomba. Mario wants the bullet to reach goomba after at least 888 seconds. So, he should fire the bullet after 444 seconds."
