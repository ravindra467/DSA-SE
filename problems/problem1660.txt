b"Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nA sequence is called nice if its elements are distinct consecutive numbers, possibly in changed order.\nFor example, both (6, 7, 8) and (15, 13, 16, 14) are nice, while (4, 6), (4, 5, 5, 6) and (15, 16, 15) are not.\n\nLimak has a nice sequence.\nWhile he was in school today, someone inserted one extra number in the sequence.\nLimak has just returned and realized that the sequence isn't nice anymore!\nHe wants to remove the inserted number and make his sequence nice again.\nCan you help him to find the number that he should remove?\n\nFormally, in each test case you are given a sequence of N numbers A1, A2, ..., AN.\nYour task is to find the value X, such that removing one occurrence of X would make the sequence nice.\nIt's guaranteed that exactly one solution exists.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nThe description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the size of the new sequence.\nThe second line of a test case contains N integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the new sequence.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 a number that should be removed from the given sequence.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n3 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 109\nThe given sequence isn't nice.\nThere is exactly one solution.\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (40 points) 3 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\nSubtask #2 (60 points) Original constraints\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4\n5\n45 42 46 48 47\n3\n7 7 8\n8\n12 156 157 158 159 160 161 162\n4\n8 7 10 642\n7\n12\n10\nExplanation:\nTest case 1. The sequence A is (45, 42, 46, 48, 47). We should remove the number 42, and the remaining numbers will form a nice sequence (45, 46, 48, 47).\nTest case 2. We should remove one of two 7's to get the sequence (7, 8), which is nice."
