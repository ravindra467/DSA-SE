b"Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.\nYou are given a rooted tree with N nodes. You would like to paint each node of the tree in one of three possible colors: red, green, and blue. The following conditions must be fulfilled:\n\n\nFor each node painted red, there must be no more than R red nodes in its subtree (including this node).\n\n\nFor each node painted green, there must be no more than G green nodes in its subtree (including this node).\n\n\nFor each node painted blue, there must be no more than B blue nodes in it's subtree (including this node).\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the number of ways to paint the tree and output it modulo 1000000007.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains four integers N, R, G and B. \nThe following N-1 lines contain pairs of the nodes' numbers Ui and Vi (one pair per line), describing the edges of the tree.\n\nThe nodes are numbered from 1 to N, inclusive, and the node with the index 1 is the root of the tree.\n\nOutput\nOutput the answer to the problem on the first line.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 300\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 R, G, B \xe2\x89\xa4 300\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput #1:\n3 1 1 1\n1 2\n3 1\nOutput #1:\n12\n\n\n\nInput #2:\n8 2 1 3\n1 2\n1 4\n5 4\n7 4\n3 2\n4 6\n8 6\nOutput #2:\n613\n"
