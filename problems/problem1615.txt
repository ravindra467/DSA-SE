b"Problem\nCovid-19 virus has reached Simalokolo!\nNow Mayor Ram has to save the city!\nMayor Ram has already prepared for this situation and has created Divoc-91 virus!\nThis Divoc-91 virus can prevent Covid-19 infection!\nSimalokolo has N\xc3\x97MN \\times MN\xc3\x97M blocks.\nThe blocks are numbered from 111 to NNN row-wise and 111 to MMM column-wise.\nEach of the block has one of the three status at the time 000 (i.e starting time):\n\nInfected by Covid-19\nInfected by Divoc-91\nUn-infected\n\nNow, both the virus can spread to adjacent blocks after 111 unit of time.\nThat means if any of the virus is at block (i,j)(i,j)(i,j) currently then after 111 unit of time it will spread to:\n\n(i+1,j)(i+1,j)(i+1,j)\n(i\xe2\x88\x921,j)(i-1,j)(i\xe2\x88\x921,j)\n(i,j+1)(i,j+1)(i,j+1)\n(i,j\xe2\x88\x921)(i,j-1)(i,j\xe2\x88\x921)\n\nIf Divoc-91 reaches any block before Covid-19 or at the same time as Covid-19 ,\nthe people living in that block won't suffer from Covid-19 infection!\nNow Mayor Ram knows that if the number of blocks which will suffer from\nCovid-19 infection is more than \xe2\x8c\x88N\xe2\x88\x97M2\xe2\x8c\x89\\lceil \\frac{N*M}{2} \\rceil\xe2\x8c\x882N\xe2\x88\x97M\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x8c\x89 then he won't have enough supporting voters for next elections and he will have to announce a FAKE 20 LAKH CRORE Simalokolan-Dollar package for the public to save his face!\nYou are given the locations of Covid-19 and Divoc-91 infections at time 000.\nCalculate the number of blocks which will have suffered from Covid-19 infections after a very long time!\nNote: Even if Covid-19 won't infect the people of some blocks , it can still spread from that block to other blocks because it can spread through air too!\n### Input:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nThe first line of each testcase contains two integers NNN and MMM denoting the number of rows and the number of columns respectively.\nThe next line contains an integer CCC denoting the number of cities infected by Covid-19 at time 0.\nThe next CCC lines each have two integers rrr and ccc denoting the row number and column number of the infected city.\nThe next line contains an integer DDD denoting the number of cities infected by Divoc-91 at time 0.\nThe next DDD lines each have two integers rrr and ccc denoting the row number and column number of the infected city.\nIt is guarenteed that no city is infected by both viruses at time 0.\n\n### Output:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line the number of blocks which will suffer from Covid-19 infections.\n### Constraints \n- 1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\leq T \\leq 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n- 1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\leq N,M \\leq 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4103\n- 0\xe2\x89\xa4C,D\xe2\x89\xa4N\xc3\x97M0 \\leq C,D \\leq N \\times M0\xe2\x89\xa4C,D\xe2\x89\xa4N\xc3\x97M\n- 1\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq r \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4N\n- 1\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa4M1 \\leq c \\leq M1\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa4M\n- Sum of N\xc3\x97MN \\times MN\xc3\x97M over all test cases doesn't exceed 10510^5105\n### Sample Input:\n\t1\n\t3 3\n\t1\n\t1 1\n\t1\n\t3 3### Sample Output:\n\t3### EXPLANATION:\nBlocks (1,1),(1,2),(2,1)(1,1),(1,2),(2,1)(1,1),(1,2),(2,1) will suffer from Covid-19."
