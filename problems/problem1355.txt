b'Problem\nYou have a dog named Cheems. He also has a girlfriend Cheema.\nFor Valentines Day, Cheems want to gift something to Cheema. He decided to give her a series of blocks painted with Cheema\xe2\x80\x99s photos. But he can only paint in steps.\nIn ithi^{th}ith step, he will paint one block and move iii blocks forward. ( iii starts from 1 ).\nFor eg, if he starts with first block, he will paint the following blocks :- 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6 (Lets denote this as one process). But he will miss many blocks in between.\nSo he has to start again by choosing a different initial block (can be any)  and follow the same process till all NNN blocks are painted. (During each process he will choose an initial block and follow the above given steps).\nHe is allowed to paint one block one or more times.\nCheems is weak in maths and lazy so he wants to paint all the boxes in minimum possible process. Help him!\n\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nEach testcase contains of a single line of input, integer NNN - total number of blocks.\n\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line minimum number of processes required to paint all the boxes.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq T \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41090 \\leq N \\leq 10^90\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\n\nSample Input:\n4\r\n1\r\n3\r\n4\r\n6\n\n\nSample Output:\n1\r\n2\r\n2\r\n3\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nTest case 1: He has only one block and he will start from that one block. So clearly one process.\nTest case 2:\n1st1^{st}1st process: 1 => 2 => 4\n2nd2^{nd}2nd process: 2 => 3 => 5\nTest case 4:\n1st1^{st}1st process: 1 => 2 => 4\n2nd2^{nd}2nd process: 3 => 4 => 6\n3rd3^{rd}3rd process: 5'
