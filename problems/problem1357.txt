b'Problem\n\nJoey is given a problem by his friend Chandler. Since he is not good in maths, he told you to help him solve the problem. Can you help Joey to solve the problem.\nThe problem is that given an array A with N integers, A[0], A[1], A[2], ... , A[N-1], you need to find an integer x, such that the \nexpression (A[0] - x)2 + (A[1] - x)2 + ... + (A[N-1] - x)2 is minimum possible.  \n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of integers in the array.\nThe second line contains N space-separated intergers denoting the array elements.\n\n\nOutput\nFor each test case output the number x in a new line.\nIf there are multiple answers output the maximum one.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100000\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 A[i] \xe2\x89\xa4 1000000\n\n\nExample Input\n1\n5\n6 2 1 9 2\n\n\nExample Output\n4\n\n\nExplanation\nFor every possible value of x, x = 4 gives the minimum value (6-4)2 + (2-4)2 + (1-4)2 + (9-4)2 + (2-4)2 = 46.\n'
