b"Problem\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese\n, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nProfessor GukiZ decided to distribute all of his candies to his NNN students (numbered 111 through NNN). Let's denote the number of candies GukiZ gave to the iii-th student by pip_ipi\xe2\x80\x8b. As GukiZ has a lot of students, he does not remember all the exact numbers of candies he gave to the students. He only remembers the following properties of the sequence ppp:\n\nThe numbers of candies given to each of the first KKK students (p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pKp_1, p_2, \\dots, p_Kp1\xe2\x80\x8b,p2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,pK\xe2\x80\x8b) are known exactly.\nAll elements of the sequence ppp are distinct.\nThe difference between the maximum and minimum element of the sequence ppp does not exceed xxx.\nThe professor gave out the biggest possible total number of candies, i.e. S=p1+p2+p3+\xe2\x80\xa6+pNS = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + \\ldots + p_NS=p1\xe2\x80\x8b+p2\xe2\x80\x8b+p3\xe2\x80\x8b+\xe2\x80\xa6+pN\xe2\x80\x8b is maximum possible.\n\nNormally, professors never lie, so the information provided by GukiZ is valid and there is at least one sequence that satisfies all conditions. GukiZ would like to know the total number of candies SSS he had at the beginning. Can you help him find this number?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NNN, KKK and xxx.\nThe second line contains KKK space-separated integers p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pKp_1, p_2, \\dots, p_Kp1\xe2\x80\x8b,p2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,pK\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of candies GukiZ had.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4501 \\le T \\le 501\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa450\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\le N \\le 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4min(N,2\xe2\x8b\x85104)1 \\le K \\le \\mathrm{min}(N, 2 \\cdot 10^4)1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4min(N,2\xe2\x8b\x85104)\n0\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa41090  \\le x \\le 10^90\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\le p_i \\le 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4pi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid iii\nthere is at least one valid distribution of candies to students\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n4 3 4 \n2 1 5\n2 2 9\n3 612\n9\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: There are four students. We know that the first student got p1=2p_1 = 2p1\xe2\x80\x8b=2 candies, the second student got p2=1p_2 = 1p2\xe2\x80\x8b=1 and the third got p3=5p_3 = 5p3\xe2\x80\x8b=5 candies; we don't know the number of candies given to the last student. The difference between the maximum and minimum number of candies given to students is already 5\xe2\x88\x921=4=x5-1 = 4 = x5\xe2\x88\x921=4=x, so the fourth student could only have been given between 111 and 555 candies. It can't be 555 either, so we maximize the number of candies if we give 444 candies to the fourth student. In total, there are 2+1+5+4=122 + 1 + 5 + 4 = 122+1+5+4=12 candies.\nExample case 2: We know the number of candies given to each of the two students, so we know that GukiZ had 3+6=93 + 6 = 93+6=9 candies."
