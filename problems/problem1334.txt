b"Problem\nAfter a lot of effort, Mausil Hash of SDC has been able to convince Sarma Templeton Investments to take placements interview. While you were browsing through the previous year's questions you came across the following question. The problem statement is as follows:\nThere are NNN piles of chocolates where each pile has CiC_iCi\xe2\x80\x8b number of chocolates. At each turn you will select a pile and eat KKK chocolates from it. You have to eat all the chocolates from all the piles in at most DDD turns. Find the smallest KKK such that you can eat all the chocolates in at most DDD turns.\nThe director of the company Mr. Sarma likes people who write small codes. Try to impress him by writing your code as small as possible.\n[Note: If at a moment no. of chocolates in a pile is less than KKK, then you will eat all of those chocolates and it is still counted as a normal turn.]\nInput:\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers denoting NNN and DDD respectively.\nThe second line contains NNN space separated integers denoting C1,C2,\xe2\x80\xa6.CNC_1, C_2, \xe2\x80\xa6. C_NC1\xe2\x80\x8b,C2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6.CN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput:\n\nPrint only one line containing a single integer denoting the smallest KKK as explained in the problem statement.\nIf it is not possible to find such KKK, then print \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051\\leq N \\leq 10^5 1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ci\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\leq C_i \\leq 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4Ci\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq D \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSample Input:\n5 7\n1 2 4 2 4\n### Sample Output:\n2\n"
