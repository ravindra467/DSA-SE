The next n lines will contain two space separated integers si and di denoting the start date and duration of days, respectively.\n\nOutput\nThe output will contain a single line containing space separated integers which would be the serial numbers of events, starting from 1,2,...n which are supposed to be hosted in the Maracana stadium, such the stadium is used to its fullest.
