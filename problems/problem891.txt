b'Problem\nGiven a Matrix  of size NXNN X NNXN you have to reach the middle point of the matrix by breaking all the boundaries from any one  point i.e. any no on (i,j) of boundary or the perimeter in one box.\nIf you break any one element on a boundary then you can directly go to the next inner boundary or inner box then you have to break this box and further move in until you have reached the middle of the square matrix.\nIf the side of the square matrix is odd then you have to break this middle element too.\nEach element of this matrix has a particular energy that is consumed in breaking this element. Now tell me what is the minimum energy consumed in moving to its middle.  Square Matrix has side NNN.\nBoundaries in matrix can be created as follow:\n\nfor this case: ans=1+2ans=1+2ans=1+2\n### Input:\n\nFirst line will contain NNN, side of the square. Then the testcases follow.\nA matrix of size NNN*NNN . containing integer values AiAiAi\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line answer the minimum energy required to reach the centre.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq N \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4100000001 \\leq Ai \\leq 100000001\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa410000000### Sample Input:\n3\n2 \t2 \t 4\n5\t20\t 4\n1\t2 \t 1### Sample Output:\n21\nEXPLANATION:\n\n\nFirst We will break outer box from 1 then inner box with energy 20 so total energy consumed is 1+20=21.'
