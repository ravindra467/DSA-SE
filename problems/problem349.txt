b"Problem\nIt's Morty's birthday today! As his birthday gift, Rick gives him weird gifts every year. This time, he got something really unique from the planet Gazorpazorp.\nThe gift is a box on which are written NNN numbers, in the form of an array. On the back, there's a 'special number' KKK printed. Finally on the top, there's a digital lock attached.\nRick tells Morty that the box can be opened, only when he enters the number of subsets of array whose multiplication of elements is divisible by KKK, modulo 109+710^9+7109+7, as the passcode.\nAs Morty is busy with his birthday party, he hands over the box to you. Can you crack the passcode?\nInput:\n\n\nFirst line will contain NNN and KKK.\n\n\nNext line will contain NNN integers denoting the elements of the array.\n\n\nOutput:\nPrint a single integer, the count of subsets whose multiplication of elements is divisible by KKK modulo 109+710^{9}+7109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100001 \\leq N \\leq 100001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\leq K \\leq 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A[i]\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\leq A[i] \\leq 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4A[i]\xe2\x89\xa4106\n\nSample Input:\n4 2\n\n1 2 3 4\nSample Output:\n12\n\nEXPLANATION:\n  Total subsets are 15. {1}, {3} and {1,3} are not divisible by 2.\n"
