b"Problem\nGoku and vegeta are fighting rigorously from a long time, but they can't arrive to a conclusion that who is better and stronger than the other. So they decided to do it by other means.\nBoth of them started playing chess on an N\xc3\x97MN \xc3\x97 MN\xc3\x97M chess-board and vegeta has already placed RRR Black rooks on the chess-board and then he asks goku to place one White rook on the chess-board such that it is safe . As we all know that goku is a big dumb head and can't do it by himself , we need to help him.\nFind the probability of goku making a correct move . The probability is in form of P/QP/QP/Q , where you need to find and print PPP and QQQ which are both co-prime integers .\nNOTENOTENOTE : HowHowHow DoesDoesDoes AAA RookRookRook Attack??Attack??Attack??\nWhen a rook is placed on co-ordinates (XXX,YYY) , It attacks Whole Row No XXX and Column No YYY\n\n### Input:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nFirst line of each testcase contains two space separated integers N,MN, MN,M.\nSecond line contains one integer RRR, which denotes number of rooks already placed.\nNext RRR lines contains two space separated integers XXX , YYY depicting co-ordinates of the respective rook .\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output should contain two space separated integers PPP and QQQ .\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\leq T \\leq 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\leq N,M \\leq 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4(N\xc3\x97M)\xe2\x88\x9211 \\leq R \\leq (N\xc3\x97M)-11\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4(N\xc3\x97M)\xe2\x88\x921\n\nSubtasks\n\n20 points : 1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq N,M \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4100\n30 points : 1\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4MAX(N,M)1 \\leq R \\leq MAX(N,M)1\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4MAX(N,M)\n50 points : (original(original(original constraints)constraints)constraints)\n\nSample Input:\n    3\n    8 8\n    1\n    5 3\n    6 6\n    2\n    5 3\n    3 5\n    2 2\n    2\n    1 1\n    2 2\n\nSample Output:\n    49 64\n    4 9\n    0\n### EXPLANATION:\n\nTest\xe2\x88\x92Case:1Test-Case:1Test\xe2\x88\x92Case:1\n\nFrom this chessboard we can see that goku's probability to make right move is 49/6449/6449/64 so the ans is 494949 646464\nTest\xe2\x88\x92Case:2Test-Case:2Test\xe2\x88\x92Case:2\n\nFrom this chessboard we can see that goku's probability to make right move is 16/36=4/916/36 = 4/916/36=4/9 so the ans is 444 999\nTest\xe2\x88\x92Case:3Test-Case:3Test\xe2\x88\x92Case:3\n\nFrom this chessboard we can see there's no place to move for goku so the probability is 000"
