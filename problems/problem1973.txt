b"Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nThere are 10 types of viruses \xe2\x80\x94 one type with strength 0, one type with strength 1, and so on, up to the last type with strength 9.\nLimak examines the behavior of a row of N viruses, indexed 1 through N. The initial situation is represented by a string S that consists of N digits, denoting the strengths of the viruses.\nStronger viruses will slowly defeat the weaker ones and convert them into their own type. While it's easy for a very strong virus to defeat a very weak one, the distance between them is an obstacle. Formally, we say that a virus with index x affects (tries to attack) a virus with index y (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 x, y \xe2\x89\xa4 N) if and only if:\nstrength(x) - strength(y) \xe2\x89\xa5 |x - y|\nFor example, a virus with strength 8 affects a virus with strength 5 if and only if the distance between them (the absolute difference between indices) is at most 3. Also, a virus always affects itself. Note that a virus can never affect stronger viruses.\nIn one second, simultaneously, each virus V is replaced with a virus whose type is the strongest among all the viruses that were affecting V at that moment.\nLimak wants to know when this process will stop, i.e. when all N viruses will have the same type.\nIt can be proved that such a situation must happen eventually.\nCan you help Limak and compute the number of seconds after which the process will stop?\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe only line of each test case contains one string S, consisting of digits '0' through '9'.\nWe have let N denote the length of S.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of seconds the process will last (after which all N viruses will have the same type).\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 3\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 150,000\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask #1 (20 points): 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 50\nSubtask #2 (30 points): It's guaranteed that the answer won't exceed 10.\nSubtask #3 (10 points): S contains digits '0' and '1' only.\nSubtask #4 (40 points): Original constraints.\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n555755555\n311110000000000\n077880007443\n6\n4\nExplanation:\nTest case 1. In the string 555755555, the virus with index 4 (the one with strength 7) affects two viruses to the left, and two viruses to the right, i.e. viruses with indices 2, 3, 5 and 6. These four viruses will be changed to strength 7 after the first second. The new string will be 577777555.\nIn the next second, viruses with indices 1, 7 and 8 will be changed, and the string will become 777777775.\nFinally, in the third second, the last virus will be changed to strength 7 as well.\nThe process stops after 3 seconds in total.\nTest case 2. The string changes in the following way:\n\n311110000000000 initially\n333111000000000 after 1 second\n333331100000000 after 2 seconds\n333333330000000 after 3 seconds\n333333333330000 after 4 seconds\n333333333333330 after 5 seconds\n333333333333333 after 6 seconds\n\nTest case 3. The string changes in the following way:\n\n07788000744 initially\n87888888777 after 1 second\n88888888877 after 2 seconds\n88888888887 after 3 seconds\n88888888888 after 4 seconds\n"
