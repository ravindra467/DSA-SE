b'Problem\nRead problems statements in Mandarin chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef decided to order NNN lemons for a future Lemon Festival. The company "LemEx" that delivers lemons provides 3,0003,0003,000 yellow trucks and one red truck, and Chef wants to fully use them all. The trucks have identical capacities, so Chef wants each truck to transfer the same number of lemons.\nYou are given a string MMM and an integer KKK. The decimal representation of the number NNN can be obtained by concatenating MMM with itself KKK times, e.g. if M=903M = 903M=903 and K=3K = 3K=3, it means that N=903903903N = 903903903N=903903903. You are not allowed to add any leading zeroes to this decimal representation, however, it may initially contain leading zeroes.\nIt could be possible that NNN lemons cannot be delivered while satisfying the given rule. Therefore, Chef may change an arbitrary number of digits (possibly zero) in the decimal representation of NNN, i.e. choose a number of positions in this string and change each of the digits at these positions to a different digit. However, it is not allowed to change two or more digits with identical original values (at different positions). There are no restrictions on the resulting values of any digits; specifically, the resulting number is also allowed to contain leading zeroes.\nFind the number of ways to change the number NNN so that all lemons can be delivered by LemEx. Since this number can be very large, we ask you to compute it modulo 109+710^9 + 7109+7.\nInput\nThe first and only line of the input contains a string MMM, followed by a space and an integer KKK.\nOutput\nPrint a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of ways to change the number of lemons modulo 109+710^9 + 7109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3M\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa41,000,0001 \\le |M| \\le 1,000,0001\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3M\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa41,000,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\le K \\le 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4109\neach character of MMM is a digit between \'0\' and \'9\' inclusive\nMMM may contain leading zeroes\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3012 14\nExplanation:\nWe have MMM equal to "3012" and K=1K = 1K=1, so N=3012N = 3012N=3012 (once repeated MMM). The decimal representation of NNN can be changed to "0000" (the number 000), "3001", "6002" or "9003".'
