b"Problem\n\xc2\xa0\nArya's birthday is here and he has received many gifts. He has received a total of N gifts from his N friends. Each of these friends has gifted him with K numbers.\n\nNow, for each of these gifts he received, Arya has calculated the XOR of all the numbers in the i-th gift.\n\nFurthermore, he found the bitwise AND, S of all these XOR values.\nSince he hates being the center of attention in a party, he has decided to minimize the value of S. However, so as not to seem rude, he can only toggle at most one bit at any position of a number in any gift that he recieved.\n\nSince, Arya is busy managing his guests, he needs your help to find the minimum value of S.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\nThe first lint contains T,the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test cases contains two space separated integers, N and K.\nThe subsequent N lines contain K space separated integers G[i] denoting each number gifted by that friend.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\nPrint T lines, where each line contains the answer to the corresponding test case.\n\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T\xe2\x89\xa4 1000 \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N,K\xe2\x89\xa4 1000 \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 G[i]\xe2\x89\xa4 (2^10)-1\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\n1\n2 2\n1 2\n3 4\nOutput:\n1\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nExample case 1.\n\nXOR of all values in the first row: 3\n\nXOR of all values in the second row: 7\n\n\nOn toggling the 2nd (from the right) bit of the first gift of the first friend, the minimum answer is received.\n\n\nXOR of all values in the first row: 1\n\nXOR of all values in the second row: 7\n\n\n1 AND 7 = 1.\n"
