b'Problem\nChef and Chefina have decided to play the game of cubes and coins. There are NNN cubes placed in a straight line numbered 111 through NNN. The iii-th cube has a point PiP_iPi\xe2\x80\x8b associated with it. Each player takes alternate turns and proceeds as follows -\n\nIf only a single cube is left, player picks it.\nOtherwise, he/she tosses an unbiased coin. If the coin lands on heads, player takes the first cube otherwise they take the last cube.\n\nWhat is the expected total points Chef will get if he goes first?\nNote: The unbiased coin lands on heads with probability 0.5 (and hence lands on tails with the same probability). Also, the total point is the sum of points of all cubes that Chef will get.\nInput Format\n\nFirst line of the input contains an integer TTT, the number of test cases. TTT test cases follow. Each test case consists of exactly 2 lines.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN, the number of cubes.\nThe second line contains NNN space separated integers P1P_1P1\xe2\x80\x8b, P2P_2P2\xe2\x80\x8b, ........., PNP_NPN\xe2\x80\x8b, the points associated with cubes in the order they lie in a line.\n\nOutput Format\nOutput for each test case should contain a single real number in a separate line, the expected total points Chef will get for this particular test.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45001 \\leq T \\leq 5001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4500\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa420001 \\leq N \\leq 20001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Si\xe2\x89\xa49990 \\leq S_i \\leq 9990\xe2\x89\xa4Si\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4999\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4\n1\n100\n2\n42 0\n3\n1 4 9\n4\n5 5 5 5\n100.000\n21.000\n9.500\n10.000\n\nExplanation:\nCaseCaseCase 1:1:1: In the first move Chef has to take 100100100, and this is the only move. Hence, the expected points Chef will get is 100100100.\nCaseCaseCase 2:2:2: It is quite clear that Chef will make only 1 move. As he can get 424242 or 000 with equal probability, the expected points he will get is equal to 0.5\xe2\x88\x9742+0.5\xe2\x88\x970=210.5 * 42 + 0.5 * 0 = 210.5\xe2\x88\x9742+0.5\xe2\x88\x970=21.'
