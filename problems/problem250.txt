b'Problem\nYou are given a tree consisting of NNN nodes. The nodes are numbered from 111 to NNN. The tree is rooted at the node 111.\nA tree is a connected undirected graph with N\xe2\x88\x921N \xe2\x88\x92 1N\xe2\x88\x921 edges.\nFind the sum of the distance between nodes xxx and yyy over all tuples (u,v,x,yu, v, x, yu,v,x,y) satisfying the following conditions:\n1)1)1) u<vu \\lt vu<v\n2)2)2) uuu is the ancestor of node xxx and vvv is the ancestor of node yyy.\n3)3)3) Neither of uuu or vvv is the ancestor of the other.\nSince the sum can be enormous, print it modulo (109+7)(10^9 + 7)(109+7).\nNote:\n\n\nThe distance between two nodes of a tree is the number of edges in the shortest path between these two nodes.\n\n\nNode xxx is considered to be the ancestor of yyy if xxx lies on the path from 111 to yyy.\n\n\nUsually, there is no bound on the stack memory and is equal to the total memory limit of 1.5 GB. But due to a system configuration issue, the stack limit for C++ is temporarily set to 8 MB. So, if you believe that your code requires a larger stack limit, please include this in your code.\n\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test contains an integer NNN, denoting the number of nodes in the tree.\nN\xe2\x88\x921N - 1N\xe2\x88\x921 lines follow. The ithi^{th}ith of these lines contains two space-separated integers uiu_iui\xe2\x80\x8b and viv_ivi\xe2\x80\x8b, denoting an edge between the nodes uiu_iui\xe2\x80\x8b and viv_ivi\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output in a single line the sum obtained modulo (109+7)(10^9 + 7)(109+7).\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa420001 \\leq T \\leq 20001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa42000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le u_i, v_i \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4ui\xe2\x80\x8b,vi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4N\nIt is guaranteed that the given nodes and edges construct a tree.\nThe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 10610^6106\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4\n3\n1 2\n2 3\n3\n1 2\n1 3\n5\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n2 5\n6\n1 2\n1 3\n3 4\n2 5\n2 6\n0\n2\n8\n54\n\nExplanation:\nTest case 111: There is no such tuple satisfying the constraints.\nTest case 222: (2,3,2,3)(2, 3, 2, 3)(2,3,2,3) is the only valid tuple and distance between node 222 and node 333 is 222.'
