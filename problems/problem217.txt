b'Problem\nAlice and Bob have invented a new game. They have a rooted tree having NNN nodes (rooted at node 111), and the ithi^{th}ith node has the value AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b associated with it (111-indexed). The value associated with the root node is 000.\nThey start with a marker at the root node, and a score of 000. Alice and Bob moves alternatively, with Alice moving first. In one move, they can move the pointer from a node to one of its child node, and add the value associated with that child node to the score. If the marker reaches a leaf node, the game ends.\nAlice wants to minimize the score of the game, whereas Bob wants to maximize the score. They were about to start the game when the Charlie arrives. He looked at the game, and declared the game to be boring. However, Charlie asked them - "What will be the score at the end of the game, if each\\textbf{each}each one of you can skip at\xc2\xa0most\\textbf{at most}at\xc2\xa0most KKK moves?"\nCan you help Alice and Bob to answer Charlie?\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer TTT, denoting the number of testcases. The description of the TTT testcases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space separated integers NNN and KKK.\nThe second line of each test case contains NNN space separated integers A1,A2,...,ANA_1, A_2,..., A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,...,AN\xe2\x80\x8b. It is guaranteed that A1=0A_1 = 0A1\xe2\x80\x8b=0.\nThe following N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two space separated integers xxx and yyy, which denotes that there is an edge between nodes xxx and yyy.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each testcase, output in a single line the answer to the Charlie\'s problem.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\leq T \\leq 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa42000 \\leq K \\leq 2000\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4200\n\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4109-10^9 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^9\xe2\x88\x92109\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq x, y \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4N\nThe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 10510^5105\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n3 1\n0 1 2\n1 2\n1 3\n4 0\n0 1 2 3\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n7 0\n0 2 1 4 2 7 3\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n2 5\n3 6\n3 7\n1\n2\n6\n\nExplanation:\nTest Case 111: Alice can move the marker to node 222, and hence making score =1= 1=1. If Alice skips her chance, then Bob can move the marker to node 333, and hence making score = 222. Therefore, Alice will not skip her chance.\nTest Case 222: If Alice moves the marker to node 222, then Bob will move the marker to node 444, making score = 444. If Alice moves the marker to node 333, the game will end, and the score will be 222.'
