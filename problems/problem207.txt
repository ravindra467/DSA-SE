b'Problem\nChef is again playing a game with his best friend Garry. As usual, the rules of this game are extremely strange and uncommon.\nFirst, they are given a stack of NNN discs. Each disc has a distinct, non-negative integer written on it. The players exchange turns to make a move. Before the start of the game, they both agree upon a set of positive integers  SSS of size KKK. It is guaranteed that S contains the integer 111. In a move, a player can select any value xxx from SSS and pop exactly xxx elements from the top of the stack. The game ends when there are no discs remaining. Chef goes first.\nScoring: For every disc a player pops, his score increases by 2p2^p2p where ppp is the integer written on the disc. For example, if a player pops the discs, with integers p1,p2,p3,\xe2\x80\xa6,pmp_1, p_2, p_3, \\dots, p_mp1\xe2\x80\x8b,p2\xe2\x80\x8b,p3\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,pm\xe2\x80\x8b written on it, during the entire course of the game, then his total score will be 2p1+2p2+2p3+\xe2\x8b\xaf+2pm2^{p_1} + 2^{p_2} + 2^{p_3} + \\dots + 2^{p_m}2p1\xe2\x80\x8b+2p2\xe2\x80\x8b+2p3\xe2\x80\x8b+\xe2\x8b\xaf+2pm\xe2\x80\x8b.\nThe player with higher score wins the game. Determine the winner if both the players play optimally, or if the game ends in a draw.\nInput:\n\nFirst line contains TTT, the number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space separated integers NNN and KKK, denoting the size of the stack and the set S respectively.\nNext line contains NNN space separated integers AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b where A1A_1A1\xe2\x80\x8b is the topmost element, denoting the initial arrangement of the stack.\nThe last line of each test case contains KKK space separated integers each denoting xix_ixi\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output "Chef" (without quotes) if Chef wins, "Garry" (without quotes) if Garry wins, otherwise "Draw" (without quotes) in a separate line.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq T \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4min\xe2\x81\xa1(100,N)1 \\leq K \\leq \\min(100, N)1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4min(100,N)\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41090 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^90\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq x_i \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4N\nxi\xe2\x89\xa0xjx_i \\neq x_jxi\xe2\x80\x8b\xee\x80\xa0=xj\xe2\x80\x8b for all i\xe2\x89\xa0ji \\neq ji\xee\x80\xa0=j\nAi\xe2\x89\xa0AjA_i \\neq A_jAi\xe2\x80\x8b\xee\x80\xa0=Aj\xe2\x80\x8b for all i\xe2\x89\xa0ji \\neq ji\xee\x80\xa0=j\nSet SSS contains integer 111.\nSum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 10510^5105.\n\nSample Input:\n1\r\n3 2\r\n5 7 1\r\n1 2\n\nSample Output:\nChef\n\nExplanation:\nChef can select 2 from the set and draw the top two discs (with integers 5 and 7 written on it) from the stack. Garry cannot select 2 from the set as there is only 1 disc left in the stack. However, he can select 1 from the set and pop the last disc.\nSo, Chef\'s score = 252^525 + 272^727 = 160160160\nGarry\'s score = 212^121 = 222\nChef wins.'
