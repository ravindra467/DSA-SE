b'Problem\nNaruto wants to visit NNN villages. Since he is busy, he will be sending his clones instead. He can make as many clones as he wants. In fact, his clones can also make clones. In particular, two villages are connected if there is a path in between them.\nEach village has a number between 111 to NNN (inclusive). They are connected by paths. The whole network of village is in the form of a tree with its root being village 111. On the first day, Naruto sends a clone to village 111. The clone stays there for the day and on the next day, it multiplies into  KKK clones, where KKK is equal to the number of unvisited villages connected to the current villages the clone is in. Then, 111 clone is sent to each of the unvisited villages. The process is repeated for each village until all villages are visited. If no unvisited villages are connected to a village, then the clone simply disappears after paying the visit.\nAssume that it takes no time in making clones and going from 111 village to other.\nThe clones take energy from the real Naruto so he would want to be prepared for the day when the number of clones will be maximum. Help him find this day. In case there is more than 111 answer, print the one with the lowest day number.### Input:\n\nFirst line contains NNN, the number of villages.\nEach of the next N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921 lines contains two space-separated integers xxx and yyy denoting that villages xxx and yyy are connected by a path.\n\nOutput:\n\nPrint, in a new line, the day on which there will be the maximum number of clones.  In case there is more than 1 answer, print the one with the lowest day number.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq x,y\\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4x,y\xe2\x89\xa4N\nx!=yx!=yx!=y\n\nSample Input:\n5\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n3 5\n\nSample Output:\n2### Explaination\nOn day 111, there is only one clone. On day 222, the clone multiplies into 333 and 111 clone goes to each of the villages 222,333 and 444. Hence there are 333 clones on day 222. For day 333, clones in village 222 and 444 dissapear, clone in village 333 multplies into 111 which goes to village 555. Hence there is 111 clone on day 333. Thus answer is 222.'
