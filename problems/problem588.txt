b'Problem\nSome like to collect coins, some caps, some stickers. But Tom likes to collect cut-outs of words from the newspaper. The most weird fact is that he decides a word WWW for a newspaper and cuts out its occurrences from that newspaper. But he is lazy, he skims through the newspaper and whenever he finds an occurrence of WWW in the newspaper, he cuts it out. In this process he might skip some occurrences. Also, some occurrences might overlap, for example in ababaababaababa, the occurrences of abaabaaba is overlapping. So, if Tom cuts out one of the occurrences, the other no longer exists.\nGiven a newspaper as a string NNN (containing only lowercase English letters) [very weird newspaper indeed!] and a word WWW (also containing only lowercase English letters), find the total number of ways in which Tom can cut out at least one occurrence of WWW in NNN. (See sample input for better understanding).\nInput:\n\nFirst line contains a single integer TTT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nEach test case contains two lines. The first line of each test case contains the string NNN.\nThe second line of each test case contains the string WWW.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, output a single line containing a single integer denoting the total number of ways in which Tom can cut out at least one occurrence of WWW in NNN. As this answer can be large, output the answer modulo 100000000710000000071000000007. (See sample input and explanation for better understanding).\nConstraints:\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\le T \\le 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3W\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3N\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa42\xc3\x971051 \\le |W| \\le |N| \\le 2\\times 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3W\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3N\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa42\xc3\x97105\nWWW and NNN contain only lowercase English letters\n\nSample Input:\n3\r\ncabc\r\nab\r\ncabc\r\nc\r\nababa\r\naba\n\nSample Output:\n1\r\n3\r\n2\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the first test case, there is only one occurrence of ababab in cabccabccabc. Hence, no. of ways of cutting out at least one occurrence of ababab is 111.\nIn the second test case, ccc occurs twice. Hence, no. of ways of cutting out at least one occurrence of ccc is 333 (just the first, just the second, and cutting both first and second).\nIn the third test case, abaabaaba occurs twice, but they are overlapping. So, if the first occurrence is cut out, the second occurrence no longer exists. Hence, no. of ways of cutting out at least one occurrence of abaabaaba is 222 (just the first occurrence and just the second occurrence).\n'
