b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChefland is a country with NNN cities (numbered 111 through NNN) connected by MMM bidirectional roads. Chef is on a mission to spread a secret recipe of a Rogan Josh dish. Chef has a sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AKA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_KA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AK\xe2\x80\x8b and he must visit cities in the following way: he starts in the city A1A_1A1\xe2\x80\x8b, travels to the city A2A_2A2\xe2\x80\x8b, then travels from there to the city A3A_3A3\xe2\x80\x8b and so on until he reaches the city AKA_KAK\xe2\x80\x8b. Note that a city may appear in AAA multiple times, but Ai\xe2\x89\xa0Ai+1A_i \\neq A_{i+1}Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xee\x80\xa0=Ai+1\xe2\x80\x8b for each valid iii. When travelling between two cities, Chef always follows one of the shortest paths between them (but not necessarily the same one if he travels between them again).\nThe government is trying to track which cities are targeted by Chef. However, they do not know the sequence AAA. Instead, they have tracked Chef's movement as a sequence B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BLB_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_LB1\xe2\x80\x8b,B2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,BL\xe2\x80\x8b of cities visited by Chef during his mission. Formally, B1=A1B_1 = A_1B1\xe2\x80\x8b=A1\xe2\x80\x8b is the city where Chef starts, then for each valid iii, he moves from the city BiB_iBi\xe2\x80\x8b to the city Bi+1B_{i+1}Bi+1\xe2\x80\x8b using the direct road between them and finally, he ends his mission in the city BL=AKB_L = A_KBL\xe2\x80\x8b=AK\xe2\x80\x8b; Chef's sequence AAA is a subsequence of BBB, since the sequence BBB also contains all shortest paths which Chef followed. It is guaranteed that there is a direct road between cities BiB_iBi\xe2\x80\x8b and Bi+1B_{i+1}Bi+1\xe2\x80\x8b for each valid iii.\nHelp the government of Chefland find the minimum possible number of targeted cities, i.e. the minimum possible value of KKK for a sequence AAA that corresponds to the given sequence BBB, or determine that no such sequence AAA exists.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NNN, MMM and LLL.\nThe second line contains LLL space-separated integers B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BLB_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_LB1\xe2\x80\x8b,B2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,BL\xe2\x80\x8b.\nEach of the following MMM lines contains three space-separated integers uuu, vvv and www describing a road between cities uuu and vvv with length www.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum possible KKK, or \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 if a valid sequence AAA does not exist.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\le T \\le 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42002 \\le N \\le 2002\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4200\n1\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x8b\x85(N\xe2\x88\x921)/21 \\le M \\le N \\cdot (N-1)/21\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x8b\x85(N\xe2\x88\x921)/2\n2\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa410,0002 \\le L \\le 10,0002\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa410,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le u, v \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4u,v\xe2\x89\xa4N\nu\xe2\x89\xa0vu \\neq vu\xee\x80\xa0=v\n1\xe2\x89\xa4w\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\le w \\le 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4w\xe2\x89\xa4106\nthere is at most one direct road between each pair of cities\nfor each valid iii, there is a direct road between cities BiB_iBi\xe2\x80\x8b and Bi+1B_{i+1}Bi+1\xe2\x80\x8b\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points): w=1w = 1w=1\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n3 3 6\n1 2 3 1 2 3\n1 2 1\n2 3 1\n3 1 1\n4 4 9\n1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1\n1 2 1\n2 3 1\n3 4 1\n4 1 1\n3 3 2\n1 2\n1 2 3\n2 3 1\n3 1 16\n5\n-1"
