b'Problem\nIts time of Raksha Bandhan so its compulsory for every \nbrother to give a gift to his sister. \nBrother Jon is planning to give a string S of length \nL to his sister Arya. \nAfter receiving the gift from her brother, Arya decided to share \nthe string with her brother Jon.  \nString S contains characters from index 0 to \nindex L - 1. \nShe will select a pivot called P ie any index P(1 \xe2\x89\xa4 P \xe2\x89\xa4 L - 1) and divides the original string into two parts. First \npart will contain characters from index 0 to index P - 1 and second part will contain characters from index \nP to L - 1.\nJon will keep the first part and Arya will keep the second \npart. \nArya is great fan of LCP (Longest Common Prefix) so she \ndecided that she will select such an index as pivot such that  \nLCP of the two part is high.\nThough she like LCP but she does not know how to calculate \nit. Help her to solve the problem.\nArya will ask you Q questions. Each question is \nrepresented by a index P and you have to answer the LCP\n(Longest Common Prefix) of the two parts.\nInput\n First line of input contains a string S. \n Second line of input contains a positive number Q \nrepresenting the number of question Arya will ask you. \n Q lines will follow each containing a positive \nnumber P \nOutput\n Output Q numbers(the required answer). Each number \non a separate line.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Length of the string(or L)  \xe2\x89\xa4\n5 * 106\n 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 P \xe2\x89\xa4 L - 1 \n 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q(number of queries) \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n\n\nAll characters in the string will be small case english alphabets (a-z)\n\n\n\nNOTE: C++ users, please do not use cin and cout as test cases are huge, prefer scanf and printf\n\n\nExample\nInput:\nabababa\n4\n1\n2\n3\n6\nOutput:\n0\n2\n0\n1\n\nExplanation\n\nFor the first query, first part is a.and second part is bababa, hence LCP is 0.  \nFor the second query, first part is ab.and second part is ababa, hence LCP is 2.  \nFor the third query, first part is aba.and second part is baba, hence LCP is 0.  \nFor the fourth query, first part is ababab.and second part is a, hence LCP is 1.
