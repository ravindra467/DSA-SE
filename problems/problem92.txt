b"Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.\nCaptain Dehatti from Bawanian village is making strategy to win the Fake Cricket World Cup organised in his village. \nHe want his team to score runs only in 4's and 6's because he believes that scoring any runs by running will make them tired. \nHe also wants that the team does not loose more than  L wickets.\nHe now wonders in how many ways his team can score exactly R runs in B balls. Ofcourse, he assumes that the opponent bowling is awesome and will not concede any extra runs. \nFormally, He wonders how many ways can his team score exactly R runs in B balls, given that each ball can result in 4, 6, 0 , or W(wicket wont add anything to score). Atmost L wicktes are allowed [i.e. Atmost L 'W' can be there in B balls ].\nNote: His batting order is fixed i.e. After each wicket , next player to come is fixed.\nInput\nFirst line contains T, the number of test cases.\nEach test case contains 3 space separated integers, R, B and L\nOutput\nFor each test cases output the number of ways modulo 1e9+7 (i.e. 1000000007) \nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 25000\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 R \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 B \xe2\x89\xa4 300\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 L \xe2\x89\xa4 9\nNote that the answer to R = 0 , B = 2 , W =1 is 3  [ 00 , 0W , W0 ]\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput6\n10 2 9\n6 2 9\n6 1 9\n4 1 9\n5 1 9\n10 3 92\n4\n1\n1\n0\n12\nExplanation:\nExplanation for the sample input 1:\nAll possible ways to face 2 deliveries:\n00\n04\n06\n0W\nW0\nW4\nW6\nWW\n40\n44\n46\n4W\n60\n64\n66\n6W\nOnly possible ways to win the match are 46 and 64. Hence answer is 2.\nYou need to consider all sample space i.e. 4^B"
