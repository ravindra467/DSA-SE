b'Problem\nAlienAlienAlien likes to give challenges to CodezenCodezenCodezen team to check their implementation ability, this time he has given a string SSS and asked to find out whether the given string is a GOODGOODGOOD string or not.\r\nAccording to the challenge GOODGOODGOOD String is a string that has at least 333 consecutive vowels and at least 555 different consonants.\r\nFor example ACQUAINTANCESACQUAINTANCESACQUAINTANCES  is a GOODGOODGOODString ,as it contains 333 consecutive vowels  UAIUAIUAI and 555 different consonants C,Q,N,T,S{C, Q, N, T, S}C,Q,N,T,S\r\nbut  ACQUAINTACQUAINT ACQUAINT is  not ,as it contain 333 vowels but have only 4 44 different consonants\r\nC,Q,N,T{C, Q, N, T}C,Q,N,T.\nInput:\nA string input is given from Standard Input that consists of only capital letters.\nOutput:\nOutput  a single line  that  is either GOODGOODGOOD  (if string is a good string ) or \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921(if string is not good).\nConstraints\n\n8\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa410008 \\leq S \\leq 10008\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa41000\n\nSample Input 1:\nAMBITIOUSNESS\nSample Output 2:\nGOOD\nSample Input 2:\nCOOEY\nSample Output 2:\n-1'
