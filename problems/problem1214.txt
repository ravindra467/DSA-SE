b"Problem\nHurray!, As you all know  ICC Men's T20 World Cup has started. And there is a match between India and Pakistan in Dubai. \nThere are NNN people (Numbered 111 through NNN), initially person iii  is standing at position iii  to buy the match ticket. If they have a ticket counter in front of them, then it is denoted as 111 or 000 otherwise. \nThe ticket cost is KKK. All are in hurry to buy the ticket so they want to move to the ticket counter which is nearest to their position and the cost to move from position iii to jjj is \xe2\x88\xa3i\xe2\x88\x92j\xe2\x88\xa3|i-j|\xe2\x88\xa3i\xe2\x88\x92j\xe2\x88\xa3 and the total cost for the person iii is \xe2\x88\xa3i\xe2\x88\x92j\xe2\x88\xa3+K|i - j| + K\xe2\x88\xa3i\xe2\x88\x92j\xe2\x88\xa3+K. \nFind the total sum of all the costs for NNN people.\nInput Format\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nEach testcase contains two lines of input, the first line contains two integers N,KN, KN,K. The second line contains the string SSS of length NNN which contains only two characters 111 or 000 and there is at least one 111 in the string SSS.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each testcase, output in a single line answer, the total sum of all the costs for NNN people.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq T \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45\xc3\x971051 \\leq N \\leq 5 \\times 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45\xc3\x97105\n0\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41050 \\leq K \\leq 10^50\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4105\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n2 10\n10 \n3 0\n001\n21\n3\n\nExplanation:\nIn the first testcase, for person 1 the total cost is |1 - 1| + 10 = 10 and for person 2 the total cost is |2 - 1| + 10 = 11 and the total sum is 10 + 11 = 21.\nIn the second testcase, for person 1 the total cost is |1 - 3| + 0 = 2 and for person 2 the total cost is |2 - 3| + 0 = 1 and for person 3 the total cost is |3 - 3| - 0 = 0 and the total sum is 2 + 1 + 0 = 3.
