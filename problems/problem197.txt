b"Problem\nChozi is, as usual, late for his class and is stuck on a staircase where he is being very skeptic about taking them since some of the stairs are wet and Chozi is wearing very slippery shoes.\nThere are N stairs, numbered 111 to NNN, out of which KKK stairs are wet and the class is at the end of the NNN - th stair. Chozi can skip 111 or 222 stairs if needed to avoid a wet stair, i.e. if Chozi is on the iii-th stair, he can go to i+1i+1i+1-th ,i+2i+2i+2-th ,i+3i+3i+3 - th stair.\nChozi is not a very punctual student and won't mind skipping a lecture if he cannot avoid all the wet stairs. Help him find the total number of ways in which he can reach the NNN-th  stair by avoiding all the wet stairs if he only moves forward.\nFind this number of possible ways modulo 109+710^9+7109+7.\nInput:\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space separated integers NNN and KKK.\nThe second line contains KKK space-separated integers K1K_1K1\xe2\x80\x8b,K2K_2K2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,KKK_KKK\xe2\x80\x8b where each integer denotes the stair number that is wet.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, print a single line. The total ways to reach the NNN-th stair modulo 109+710^9+7109+7. ### Constraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq T \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n3\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41063 \\leq N \\leq 10^63\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\n0\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N/20 \\leq K \\leq N/20\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N/2\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ki<N1 \\leq K_i  \\lt N1\xe2\x89\xa4Ki\xe2\x80\x8b<N### Sample Input:\n1\n6 2\n2 4\n\nSample Output:\n4\n### EXPLANATION:\n\nThe possible ways are:\n[1,3,5,6],[3,5,6],[3,6]and[1,3,6][1,3,5,6] , [3,5,6], [3,6] and [1,3,6][1,3,5,6],[3,5,6],[3,6]and[1,3,6].
