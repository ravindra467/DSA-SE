b'Problem\nRead problem statement in Mandarin chinese and Vietnamese.\nSuzumo is the coach of the ChefLand OI team. Physical condition is very important in any olympiad, so he wants to make the children run a bit as a warmup.\nThe team consists of NNN children numbered 111 through NNN standing at some positions on the xxx-axis. For each valid iii, the initial xxx-coordinate of the iii-th kid is xix_ixi\xe2\x80\x8b, the running velocity of the iii-th kid is constant and equal to viv_ivi\xe2\x80\x8b.\nSuzumo wants to assign a running direction (left or right, i.e. in the direction of decreasing or increasing xxx-coordinate) to each kid; the children start running at time 000 in the assigned directions. Afterwards, Suzumo will measure the smallest time ttt at which some kid passes another one. Help Suzumo compute the maximum time ttt if he can assign the directions arbitrarily!\nNote: Child iii passes child jjj at time tijt_{ij}tij\xe2\x80\x8b if their coordinates satisfy x_i &lt; x_j at any time t &lt; t_{ij} and x_i &gt; x_j at any time t &gt; t_{ij}, or if they satisfy x_i &gt; x_j at any time t &lt; t_{ij} and xi<xjx_i \\lt x_jxi\xe2\x80\x8b<xj\xe2\x80\x8b at any time t>tijt \\gt t_{ij}t>tij\xe2\x80\x8b.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nNNN lines follow. For each valid iii, the iii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers xix_ixi\xe2\x80\x8b and viv_ivi\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one real number \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum possible time ttt, or \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 if it is possible to assign directions in such a way that no kid ever passes another. Your answer will be considered correct if it has an absolute or relative error less than or equal to 10\xe2\x88\x92610^{-6}10\xe2\x88\x926.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le T \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4501 \\le N \\le 501\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa450\n1\xe2\x89\xa4xi,vi\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\le x_i, v_i \\le 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x80\x8b,vi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid iii\nno two children have the same initial positions\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n3\n10 10\n20 30\n30 100.5\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: One optimal assignment of directions is left, right, right.'
