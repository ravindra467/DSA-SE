b'Problem\nRead problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nA string is called a Palpal string if it can be divided into contiguous substrings such that:\n\nEach character of the whole string belongs to exactly one substring.\nEach of these substrings is a palindrome with length greater than 111.\n\nFor example, "abbbaddzcz" is a Palpal string, since it can be divided into "abbba", "dd" and "zcz".\nYou are given a string sss. You may rearrange the characters of this string in any way you choose. Find out if it is possible to rearrange them in such a way that you obtain a Palpal string.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single string sss.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if the characters of sss can be rearranged to form a Palpal string or "NO" if it is impossible (without quotes).\nYou may print each character of each string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will all be treated as identical).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le T \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3s\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le |s| \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3s\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4100\nsss contains only lowercase English letters\nthe sum of \xe2\x88\xa3s\xe2\x88\xa3|s|\xe2\x88\xa3s\xe2\x88\xa3 over all test cases does not exceed 10610^6106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\nacbbbadzdz\nabcd\nxyxyxyYES\nNO\nYES\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: The string "acbbbadzdz" can be rearranged to "abbbaddzcz", which is the Palpal string mentioned above.\nExample case 2: It can be shown that "abcd" cannot be rearranged to form a Palpal string.\nExample case 3: The string "xyxyxy" is already a Palpal string, since it can divided into "xyx" and "yxy".'
