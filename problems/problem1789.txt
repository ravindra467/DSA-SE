b"Problem\nJon opened his new shop and he sells NNN number of items.\nPrice of each item is represented using an array PPP where PiP_iPi\xe2\x80\x8b represents the price of item iii.\nA customer always buys 3 items of the lowest price from his shop.\nFind out the profit Jon can make from that customer. It is guaranteed that his shop has at least 3 items.\nInput Format\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Each testcase contains of two lines of input.\nFirst line contains NNN which represents the number of items in Jon's shop.\nSecond line contains NNN space separated integers P1,P2,P3,....,PNP_1, P_2, P_3, .... , P_NP1\xe2\x80\x8b,P2\xe2\x80\x8b,P3\xe2\x80\x8b,....,PN\xe2\x80\x8b which represents the price of each item.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each testcase, output in a single line answer the profit Jon makes from those 3 items.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq T \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n3\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41053 \\leq N \\leq 10^53\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4103\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n4\n9 4 10 5 \n6\n6 2 6 4 2 10 18\n8\nExplanation:\nFirst Test Case\n3 items the customer chose = 9 + 4 + 5 = 18\nSecond Test Case\n3 items the customer chose = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8"
