b'Problem\nGiven 333 string S1S_1S1\xe2\x80\x8b, S2S_2S2\xe2\x80\x8b and XXX, find the number of non-empty substrings of XXX which can expressed as P+QP + QP+Q i.e. concatenation of strings PPP and QQQ, where PPP is some prefix of S1S_1S1\xe2\x80\x8b (possibly empty) and QQQ is some prefix of S2S_2S2\xe2\x80\x8b (possibly empty).\nA substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string. For example, "chef" is a substring of "codechef", but "def" is not.\nA prefix of a string SSS is a substring of SSS that occurs at the beginning of SSS. For example, "code" is a prefix of "codechef", but "chef" is not. Also, an empty string is a prefix of any string.\nInput Format\n\nFirst line of the input contains TTT, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nEach test case contains three lines, string S1S_1S1\xe2\x80\x8b in the first line, string S2S_2S2\xe2\x80\x8b in the second line and string XXX in the third line. All strings consist of only lowercase Latin letters.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer denoting the number of substrings of XXX that satisfy the above conditions.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq T \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3X\xe2\x88\xa3,\xe2\x88\xa3S1\xe2\x88\xa3,\xe2\x88\xa3S2\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\leq |X|, |S_1|, |S_2| \\leq 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3X\xe2\x88\xa3,\xe2\x88\xa3S1\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\xa3,\xe2\x88\xa3S2\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4106\nSum of \xe2\x88\xa3X\xe2\x88\xa3|X|\xe2\x88\xa3X\xe2\x88\xa3 over all test cases doesn\'t exceed 10610^6106.\nSum of \xe2\x88\xa3S1\xe2\x88\xa3|S_1|\xe2\x88\xa3S1\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\xa3 over all test cases doesn\'t exceed 10610^6106.\nSum of \xe2\x88\xa3S2\xe2\x88\xa3|S_2|\xe2\x88\xa3S2\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x88\xa3 over all test cases doesn\'t exceed 10610^6106.\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\nab\nbc\nabc\naa\nbb\nab\naab\nacb\nbcaabacbc5\n3\n10\nExplanation:\nTest case 1:\nThere are 6 substrings of X=abcX = abcX=abc namely [a,b,c,ab,bc,abc][a, b, c, ab, bc, abc][a,b,c,ab,bc,abc].\n\nObserve that aaa is a prefix of S1=abS_1 = abS1\xe2\x80\x8b=ab and an empty string is a prefix of S2=bcS_2 = bcS2\xe2\x80\x8b=bc. By concatenating them, we get the string aaa.\nNow an empty string is a prefix of S1S_1S1\xe2\x80\x8b and bbb is a prefix of S2S_2S2\xe2\x80\x8b. And by concatenating them, we get the string bbb.\nObserve that there is no prefix of S1S_1S1\xe2\x80\x8b starting with ccc and also no prefix of S2S_2S2\xe2\x80\x8b starting with ccc. So we cannot express the string ccc as a concatenation of prefixes.\nThe string ababab is a prefix of S1S_1S1\xe2\x80\x8b and an empty string is a prefix of S2S_2S2\xe2\x80\x8b. And by concatenation, we get ababab.\nSimilarly, an empty string is a prefix of S1S_1S1\xe2\x80\x8b and bcbcbc is a prefix of S2S_2S2\xe2\x80\x8b. And by concatenating them, we get bcbcbc.\nFinally, by taking the prefix aaa of S1S_1S1\xe2\x80\x8b and the prefix bcbcbc of S2S_2S2\xe2\x80\x8b, we get abcabcabc when we concatenate them.\n\nSo all substrings of XXX except for the substring ccc can be expressed as a concatenation of some prefix of S1S_1S1\xe2\x80\x8b and some prefix of S2S_2S2\xe2\x80\x8b. Therefore, the answer for this test case is 555.\nTest case 2:\nThere are 3 substrings of X=abX = abX=ab namely [a,b,ab][a, b, ab][a,b,ab].\n\nObserve that aaa is a prefix of S1=aaS_1 = aaS1\xe2\x80\x8b=aa and an empty string is a prefix of S2=bbS_2 = bbS2\xe2\x80\x8b=bb. By concatenating them, we get the string aaa.\nAn empty string is a prefix of S1S_1S1\xe2\x80\x8b and bbb is a prefix of S2S_2S2\xe2\x80\x8b. And by concatenating them, we get the string bbb.\nFinally, by taking the prefix aaa of S1S_1S1\xe2\x80\x8b and the prefix bbb of S2S_2S2\xe2\x80\x8b, we get ababab when we concatenate them.\n\nSo all substrings of XXX can be expressed as a concatenation of some prefix of S1S_1S1\xe2\x80\x8b and some prefix of S2S_2S2\xe2\x80\x8b. Therefore, the answer for this test case is 333.'
