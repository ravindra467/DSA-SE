b"Problem\nRead problems statements Mandarin , Bengali , Hindi , Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nArya has a pet mouse named Jack. She put Jack in a grid with NNN rows (numbered 111 through NNN) and MMM columns (numbered 111 through MMM). There are KKK cheese wedges scattered over the grid; for each wedge, we know how long it takes Jack to eat it.\nLet's denote the cell in row rrr and column ccc by (r,c)(r, c)(r,c). Initially, Jack is in the cell (1,1)(1, 1)(1,1). When Jack is in a cell (r,c)(r, c)(r,c), he can move to either of the cells (r,c\xe2\x88\x921)(r, c-1)(r,c\xe2\x88\x921) or (r,c+1)(r, c+1)(r,c+1) in 111 second. If he is in the first or last column of the grid (c=1c=1c=1 or c=Mc=Mc=M), he can also move to the cell (r+1,c)(r+1, c)(r+1,c) in 111 second. Jack can only eat a cheese wedge if he is in the same cell as the wedge.\nYour task is to help Jack find out, for each possible iii, the minimum number of seconds Jack needs to eat iii cheese wedges.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NNN, MMM and KKK.\nKKK lines follow. Each of these lines contains three space-separated integers rrr, ccc and ttt, denoting that there is a cheese wedge in cell (r,c)(r, c)(r,c) and it takes Jack ttt seconds to eat it.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing KKK space-separated integers. For each iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4K1 \\le i \\le K1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4K), the iii-th of them should denote the minimum number of seconds Jack needs to eat iii cheese wedges.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le T \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n3\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41093 \\le N, M \\le 10^93\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\le K \\le 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le r \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4N\n2\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x88\x9212 \\le c \\le M-12\xe2\x89\xa4c\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x88\x921\n1\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\le t \\le 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4t\xe2\x89\xa4109\nno two cheese wedges are in the same cell\nthe sum of KKK over all test cases does not exceed 10410^4104\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (25 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\le T \\le 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\nN,M,K\xe2\x89\xa4300 N, M, K \\le 300N,M,K\xe2\x89\xa4300\n\nSubtask #2 (75 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n3 10 5\n1 2 10\n2 2 1\n1 3 1\n1 9 1 \n2 9 13 8 14 22 32"
