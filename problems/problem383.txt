b'Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef is given a tree of N nodes.\nLet M denote the number of simple paths with at least two nodes.\nNotice that M = N * (N - 1) / 2.\nThere are (M * (M - 1) * (M - 2) / 6) unordered triples of such paths.\nYour task is to count how many of them are nice.\nA triple of paths (A, B, C) is nice if and only if either of the following conditions is satisfied:\n\nThe three paths are pairwise disjoint (no two of them share a node).\nEach pair of paths intersect with each other.\nIn other words: paths A and B share at least one node, paths A and C share at least one node, and also paths B and C share at least one node.\n\nOutput the number of nice triples of paths modulo (109+7).\n\n\tInput\n\n\tThe first line of the input contains an integer N.\n\nEach of the next N-1 lines contains two integers ai and bi denoting an edge between nodes ai and bi.\n\nOutput</h3>\n\n\n\tOutput a single integer, denoting the number of nice triples of paths modulo (109+7).\n\n\tConstraints\n\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 3*105\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 ai, bi \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n\nai \xe2\x89\xa0 bi\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask 1 (15 points):\n\n\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 2000\n\n\nSubtask 2 (57 points):\n\n\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n\n\nSubtask 3 (28 points):\n\n\n\n\t\tOriginal constraints.\n\n\n\tExample\nInput 1:\n4\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\nOutput 1:\n16\nInput 2:\n13\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n2 5\n2 6\n3 7\n4 8\n7 9\n9 10\n10 11\n11 12\n12 13\nOutput 2:\n43484\n\nExplanation</h3>\n\n<b>Example test 1.</b> Let (<b>x</b>, <b>y</b>) denote the simple path between nodes <b>x</b> and <b>y</b>.
