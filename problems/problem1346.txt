One Saturday evening, he decided to go to a club on the other side of his town.\nThe town is shaped like a grid with NNN rows (numbered 111 through NNN) and NNN columns (numbered 111 through NNN), where each cell represents a neighbourhood in the city. Let's denote the cell in row rrr and column ccc by (r,c)(r, c)(r,c). Gii lives in the cell (1,1)(1, 1)(1,1) and the club is in the cell (N,N)(N, N)(N,N). Gii also has some friends that live in the city; let's denote the number of Gii's friends in cell (i,j)(i, j)(i,j) by Ai,jA_{i, j}Ai,j\xe2\x80\x8b.\nOf course, if Gii is in some cell, he can move directly to another cell only if it shares a side with his current cell. Also, he is in quite a rush, so he will never increase his distance from the club. More formally, from a cell (i,j)(i, j)(i,j), he may only move to the cell (i+1,j)(i+1, j)(i+1,j) or (i,j+1)(i, j+1)(i,j+1); moving outside the grid is not allowed.\nWhenever Gii passes through some neighbourhood (including the one where he lives and the one with the club), all his friends from that neighbourhood decide to go to the club with him, since he is so cool. However, there is a problem: the maximum capacity of the club is X+1X+1X+1 people, so Gii may only bring along at most XXX of his friends. Chef, the club's bouncer, is very strict in imposing this rule (for safety reasons), and Gii does not want to leave any friends outside, so he wants to choose his route to the club in such a way that the number of his friends that arrive at the club with him does not exceed XXX.\nNow, Gii is wondering: what is the number of different routes he can take to the club such that he does not bring more than XXX people with him? Of course, he could immediately calculate this number, but he has better things to do, so he asked you to do it instead.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and XXX.\nNNN lines follow. For each iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le i \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N), the iii-th of these lines contains NNN space-separated integers Ai,1,Ai,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ai,NA_{i, 1}, A_{i, 2}, \\ldots, A_{i, N}Ai,1\xe2\x80\x8b,Ai,2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ai,N\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the number of ways for Gii to reach the club.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa451 \\le T \\le 51\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4201 \\le N \\le 201\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa420\n1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa410151 \\le X \\le 10^{15}1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa41015\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,j\xe2\x89\xa410151 \\le A_{i, j} \\le 10^{15}1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai,j\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa41015 for each valid i,ji, ji,j\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points): N\xe2\x89\xa410N \\le 10N\xe2\x89\xa410\nSubtask #2 (30 points): X\xe2\x89\xa4105X \\le 10^5X\xe2\x89\xa4105\nSubtask #3 (60 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n3 10\n2 2 3\n2 11 1\n2 3 1\n5 50\n2 3 4 7 12\n4 5 6 3 5\n5 5 6 9 1\n1 2 9 6 7\n5 6 7 4 72\n62\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: It takes Gii exactly four moves to get to the club. He has to avoid the (2,2)(2, 2)(2,2) neighbourhood, since bringing all his friends from there would immediately exceed the limit. There are only two routes that avoid this neighbourhood and both of them satisfy Chef's demands:\n\n(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(2,3),(3,3)(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(2,3),(3,3), where Gii brings 2+2+3+1+1=92+2+3+1+1 = 92+2+3+1+1=9 friends\n(1,1),(2,1),(3,1),(3,2),(3,3)(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)(1,1),(2,1),(3,1),(3,2),(3,3), where Gii brings 2+2+2+3+1=102+2+2+3+1 = 102+2+2+3+1=10 friends\n"
