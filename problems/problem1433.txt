b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef is a network engineer at CodeChef. Currently, he has to design a network that connects NNN computers (numbered 111 through NNN).\nThe network should consist of these NNN computers and exactly MMM cables. Usually, a cable needs to connect two different computers, but Chef is okay with connecting computers to themselves too. Therefore, let's describe a cable by the pair of computers (u,v)(u, v)(u,v) it connects, where 1\xe2\x89\xa4u\xe2\x89\xa4v\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le u \\le v \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4u\xe2\x89\xa4v\xe2\x89\xa4N. However, for each valid pair of computers (u,v)(u, v)(u,v), there must be at most one cable that directly connects this pair of computers.\nLet's define the data consumption factor of a computer as the number of computers which are directly connected to it. In particular, if a computer vvv is directly connected to itself (by a cable (v,v)(v, v)(v,v)), it is only counted as connected to itself once. The data consumption factor of the whole network is the maximum of data consumption factors of all computers.\nIn the resulting network, each computer needs to be connected (directly or indirectly) to all other computers, so that they could communicate with each other.\nDetermine whether it is possible to design such a network. If it is possible, find the minimum possible data consumption factor of the resulting network.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and MMM.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum data consumption factor or \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 if Chef cannot design a required network.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851051 \\le T \\le 5 \\cdot 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\le N \\le 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\n0\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa410150 \\le M \\le 10^{15}0\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41015\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points):\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\le N \\le 101\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa410\n0\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41030 \\le M \\le 10^30\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4103\n\nSubtask #2 (10 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41021 \\le T \\le 10^21\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4102\nSubtask #3 (10 points): 1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41031 \\le T \\le 10^31\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4103\nSubtask #4 (70 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n2 3\n5 6\n3 32\n2\n2\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: The optimal configuration (and the only configuration) of computers is to connect computers 111 and 222, connect computer 111 to itself and computer 222 to itself. Then, the consumption factor of each computer is 222 because it is directly connected to itself and the other computer.\nExample case 3: Here, the cables can connect pairs of computers (1,2)(1, 2)(1,2), (1,3)(1, 3)(1,3) and (2,3)(2, 3)(2,3). The consumption factor of each computer is 222. There is a configuration with consumption factor 111, where each computer is connected to itself, but all the computers are not connected, so this network configuration is invalid."
