b'Problem\n\xc2\xa0\nThe task is simple! You have to form a given number n using following two operations.\n\n\n Append a digit d to current number. The cost of this operation is d (0<=d<=9)\nAppend any "substring of current number" to the current number. The cost of this operation is zero\n\nYou start the process with an empty number and repeat one of the above 2 operations until you get the desired number. Print the minimum cost to form the given number.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\nFirst line will contain T (the number of test cases).\nFor each test case input is the number to be formed by the given operations.(The number can be very large).\n\nOutput\nPrint the minimum cost needed to form the given number using the given two operations.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 1010000\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n123\n1212\nOutput:\n6\n3\n'
