b"Problem\nRick has set out on a space journey to destroy asteroids. He has identified NNN different groups (numbered from 111 to NNN) of Asteroids. The size of groups G1G_1G1\xe2\x80\x8b, G2G_2G2\xe2\x80\x8b, ...., GnG_nGn\xe2\x80\x8b are given.\nUsing his superpowers, he can destroy exactly 1 asteroid from KKK different groups in 1 minute. He doesn't want to waste his superpower so he will stop once there are less than KKK groups available.\nYou want to watch him destroy these asteroids for as long as possible. Can you find the maximum number of minutes you can keep him busy?\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain NNN and KKK, number of groups and number of different groups he can destroy at once.\nSecond line contains N integers (G1G_1G1\xe2\x80\x8b, G2G_2G2\xe2\x80\x8b, ....,GnG_nGn\xe2\x80\x8b) denoting each group's size.\n\nOutput:\nPrint one integer denoting the number of minutes he will take to complete the given task.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\leq N \\leq 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N 1 \\leq K \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSample Input:\n2 2\r\n2 3\n\nSample Output:\n2\n\nEXPLANATION:\nAfter one minute,  asteroid groups will look like [1,2]\r\nAfter two minutes,  asteroid groups will look like [0,1]\r\nHe will stop after two minutes since there are less than 2 groups which have an asteroid."
