b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef's apartment consists of MMM floors (numbered 111 through MMM), and there's an elevator that is used to move between different floors. The elevator is connected with a computer which registers its movement in a sequence BBB. Whenever the elevator moves to a different floor, the computer appends the new floor number to sequence BBB. Currently, the sequence BBB has NNN elements.\nUnfortunately, the computer is infected with a virus which replaced some elements of BBB by \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921s. Chef now wants to know what could be the minimum number of times the elevator has changed its direction. That is, how many times the elevator was going up then started going down and vice versa.\nHelp chef by answering his question or determine that the sequence BBB is invalid.\nInput:\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers NNN and MMM.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BNB_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_NB1\xe2\x80\x8b,B2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum number of times the elevator has changed its direction or \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 if the given BBB sequence is invalid.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq T \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa41052 \\leq M \\leq 10^52\xe2\x89\xa4M\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Bi\xe2\x89\xa4M1 \\leq B_i \\leq M1\xe2\x89\xa4Bi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4M or Bi=\xe2\x88\x921B_i = -1Bi\xe2\x80\x8b=\xe2\x88\x921 for each valid iii\nsum of NNN over all test-cases doesn't exceed 10610^6106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points):\n\nN\xe2\x89\xa41,000N \\le 1,000N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 10,00010,00010,000\n\nSubtask #2 (50 points): Original constraints\nSample Input:\n5\r\n4 5\r\n2 3 4 3\r\n4 5\r\n2 -1 4 3\r\n4 5\r\n1 -1 -1 5\r\n5 4\r\n-1 -1 3 -1 -1\r\n5 5\r\n-1 -1 3 -1 -1\n\nSample Output:\n1\r\n1\r\n-1\r\n1\r\n0\n"
