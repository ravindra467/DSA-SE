b"Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nChef likes trees a lot. Today he has an infinte full binary tree (each node has exactly two childs) with special properties.\nChef's tree has the following special properties :\nEach node of the tree is either colored red or black.\nRoot of the tree is black intially.\nBoth childs of a red colored node are black and both childs of a black colored node are red.\n\nThe root of the tree is labelled as 1. For a node labelled v, it's left child is labelled as 2*v and it's right child is labelled as 2*v+1.\n\n\nChef wants to fulfill Q queries on this tree. Each query belongs to any of the following three types:\n\nQi \t   Change color of all red colored nodes to black and all black colored nodes to red.\nQb x y  Count the number of black colored nodes on the path from node x to node y (both inclusive).\nQr x y  Count the number of red colored nodes on the path from node x to node y (both inclusive).\n\nHelp chef accomplishing this task.\nInput\nFirst line of the input contains an integer Q denoting the number of queries. Next Q lines of the input contain Q queries (one per line). Each query belongs to one of the three types mentioned above.\nOutput \nFor each query of type Qb or Qr, print the required answer.\nConstraints1<=Q<=105\n1<=x,y<=109\nScoring\n Subtask #1: 1<=Q<=100  1<=x,y<=1000   \t         \t                      \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0: 27 pts\n Subtask #2: 1<=Q<=103  1<=x,y<=105   \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0: \xc2\xa025 pts\n Subtask #3: 1<=Q<=105  1<=x,y<=109   \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0: \xc2\xa048 pts\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput5\nQb 4 5\nQr 4 5\nQi\nQb 4 5\nQr 4 5\n2\n1\n1\n2\nExplanation:\nWith the initial configuration of the tree, Path from node 4 to node 5 is 4->2->5 and color of nodes on the path is B->R->B.\nNumber of black nodes are 2.\nNumber of red nodes are 1. \n\nAfter Query Qi, New configuration of the path from node 4 to node 5 is R->B->R.\nNumber of black nodes are 1.\nNumber of red nodes are 2. \n"
