b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nKerim is an environment-friendly guy. Today, he accepted Samir's challenge of planting 20 million trees by 2020. Currently, there are NNN trees (numbered 111 through NNN) planted at distinct positions on a line; for each valid iii, the position of the iii-th tree is AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b.\nA set of trees is beautiful if for each tree in this set (let's denote its position by xxx), there is a tree at the position x\xe2\x88\x921x-1x\xe2\x88\x921 and/or a tree at the position x+1x+1x+1.\nKerim's task is to plant some (possibly zero) trees in such a way that the resulting set of all planted trees (the initial NNN trees and those planted by Kerim) is beautiful. It is only allowed to plant trees at integer (possibly negative) positions. Find the minimum number of trees he needs to plant in order to achieve that.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer NNN.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the minimum number of trees Kerim needs to plant.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le T \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le N \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\le A_i \\le 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid iii\nA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b are pairwise distinct\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 10610^6106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (50 points):\n\nN\xe2\x89\xa41,000N \\le 1,000N\xe2\x89\xa41,000\nAi\xe2\x89\xa42,000A_i \\le 2,000Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa42,000 for each valid iii\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 10410^4104\n\nSubtask #2 (50 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n3\n2 7 42\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: Kerim should plant trees at the positions 333 and 666 to make the grid beautiful, so the answer is 222."
