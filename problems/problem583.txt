b'Problem\nThe year is 2099 and Miguel O\xe2\x80\x99Hara is playing a good ol\xe2\x80\x99 game board game with his daughter. But since they were too smart for any normal games, they made up a mind-boggling game for themselves. \nYou have a board of size NNN x NNN. Every block on the board has 1 random piece on it and every piece has an assigned value. They have to perform the following steps and give the answer wisely.\n\n\nFirstly, they have to choose a square of size KKK x KKK (where 1<=KKK\\lt=NNN) on the board such that (k\xe2\x88\x97p1)(k*p_1)(k\xe2\x88\x97p1\xe2\x80\x8b) ^ (k\xe2\x88\x97p2)(k*p_2)(k\xe2\x88\x97p2\xe2\x80\x8b) .... ^ (k\xe2\x88\x97pk)(k*p_k)(k\xe2\x88\x97pk\xe2\x80\x8b) is maximum, where ^ denotes the bitwise XOR and pip_ipi\xe2\x80\x8b is the ith element of the south-east diagonal of the square (diagonal running from top left to bottom right of the matrix)\n\n\nIf there are multiple such squares possible with the maximum XOR, choose the square having the maximum size, i.e., the number of elements present in the square.\n\n\nAs a final task, the player has to give the total number of ways WWW possible to reach the ending point(bottom right) from the starting point(top left) in the chosen square without crossing the south-east diagonal (diagonal running from top left to bottom right of matrix), moving only in the right or downward direction.(The player can move only on the boundary of the chosen square. See the below diagram for more clarity.)\n\n\nThe player has to give the maximum XOR and the number of such paths WWW as the answer.\nSince even WWW can be large, output WWW modulo 1000000007 (109+710^9 + 7109+7)\nInput Format\n\nFirst line contains the number of test cases, TTT\nSecond line contains the integer NNN.\nIn the next NNN lines, each line contains NNN, space separated integers. Where j-th integer in i-th line denote a[i][j]\n\nOutput Format\nFor every test case:\n\n2 integers, PPP, maximum achievable points for the turn, and WWW, the number of ways to get from one end of the diagonal to another without crossing it.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq T \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq N \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4a[i][j]\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq a[i][j] \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4a[i][j]\xe2\x89\xa4100\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n5\n3 4 2 6 3\n4 6 5 1 5\n5 6 5 1 4\n1 2 3 5 5\n2 4 5 2 1\n29 10\nExplanation:\n        1   2   3   4   5    --- Column Index\n\n  1     3 | 4 | 2 | 6 | 3 | \n  2     4 | 6 | 5 | 1 | 5 | \n  3     5 | 6 | 5 | 1 | 4 | \n  4     1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 5 | \n  5     2 | 4 | 5 | 2 | 1 | \n\nA piece moving from (3,2) to (5,4) passing through (4,3) would be the optimum choice\ndiagonal makes 3x3 square =3*a[3][2] ^ 3*a[5][4] ^ 3*a[4][3] = 29\nFor the diagonal (3,2) to (5,4), moving only south or east, the player has a total of 10 possible paths without crossing the diagonal as shown below.\n'
