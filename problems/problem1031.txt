b"Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.\n \nChef wants to implement wildcard pattern matching supporting only the wildcard '?'. The wildcard character '?' can be substituted by any single lower case English letter for matching. He has two strings X and Y of equal length, made up of lower case letters and the character '?'. He wants to know whether the strings X and Y can be matched or not.\nInput\nThe first line of input contain an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines, the first line contains the string X and the second contains the string Y.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line with the word Yes if the strings can be matched, otherwise output No.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 50\nBoth X and Y have equal length and the length is between 1 and 10.\nBoth X and Y consist of lower case letters and the character '?'.\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\ns?or?\nsco??\nstor?\nsco??Yes\nNo\nExplanation:\nTest case 111: One of the possible ways to match both the strings is score\\texttt{score}score. This can be done by:\n\nReplace 1st1^{st}1st and 2nd2^{nd}2nd ?\\texttt{?}? of string XXX by characters c\\texttt{c}c and e\\texttt{e}e respectively.\nReplace 1st1^{st}1st and 2nd2^{nd}2nd ?\\texttt{?}? of string YYY by characters r\\texttt{r}r and e\\texttt{e}e respectively.\n\nTest case 222: There exists no way to fill the ?\\texttt{?}? such that the strings become equal. Thus, the answer is No."
