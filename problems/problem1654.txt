b'Problem\nPushpa has entered Chefland and wants to establish Pushpa-Raj here too.\nChefland has NNN towers where the height of the ithi^{th}ith tower is HiH_iHi\xe2\x80\x8b. To establish Pushpa-Raj, Pushpa does the following:\n\nInitially, Pushpa chooses any tower iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N)(1\\le i \\le N)(1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N) and lands on the roof of that tower.\nLet XXX denote the height of the tower Pushpa is currently on, then, Pushpa can land on the roof of any tower jjj (1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4N)(1\\le j \\le N)(1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4N) such that the height of the jthj^{th}jth tower is (X+1)(X+1)(X+1).\n\nLet iii denote the index of the tower on which Pushpa lands, then, the height of all towers except tower iii increases by 111 after each jump including the initial jump.\nTo establish Pushpa-Raj, Pushpa wants to land at the maximum height possible. Determine the maximum height Pushpa can reach.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains a single integer TTT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer NNN - the number of towers\nThe second line of each test case contains NNN space-separated integers H1,H2,\xe2\x80\xa6,HNH_1, H_2, \\dots, H_NH1\xe2\x80\x8b,H2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,HN\xe2\x80\x8b denoting the initial heights of each of the towers from the ground.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output in a single line the maximum height achieved by Pushpa.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq T \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Hi\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq H_i \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Hi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n4\n1 2 1 3\n1\n23\n2\nExplanation:\n\nTest case 111: If Pushpa chooses to start from tower at index 111 with height of 111 unit, then, the new heights will be [1,3,2,4][ 1, 3, 2, 4 ][1,3,2,4]. He can then jump to the 3rd3^{rd}3rd tower (with height 222 units). The updated heights of the towers is [2,4,2,5][2, 4, 2, 5][2,4,2,5]. Pushpa is unable to make any more jumps.\n\nThe optimal way to in this case is to take an initial jump at tower 444 with height 333. The maximum height Pushpa can reach is 333.\n\nTest case 222: There is only 111 tower so Pushpa reaches the maximum height of 222 units.\n'
