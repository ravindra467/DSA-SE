b'Problem\nIPL session is On. Cricket matches are being played in "N" different stadiums of India(stadium number is 0 based indexed).\nAll stadium are connected to each other, and distance between all the adjacent stadium are same i.e One.\nThe chef is currently in the Stadium number of 0.\nAs the chef is busy watching IPL so you have to find the stadium which is farthest from stadium 0 and also find that distance.\nNote:\nIf more than one stadiums are farthest from stadium 0 then print the stadium number which is minimum.\nInput Format:\nThe First Line contains 2 space-separated integers N and E,i.e N is the number of stadiums and E is the number of paths connecting two stadiums.\nNext, E lines contain 2 space-separated integers denoting the stadium number which are connected to each other.\nOutput Format:\nPrint the stadium number which is farthest from stadium 0 as well as its distance from stadium 0.\nConstraints:\n1 <= N <= 10^5\n1 <= E <= 10^5\nSample Input:\n10 9\n0 1\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n5 6\n4 7\n7 8\n8 9  ### Sample Output:\n9 7  ### Explainations:\nIf you make a graph with the above data then you can easily see that Stadium 9 is farthest from Stadium 0 and its distance is 7, so output is [9 7].'
