b'Problem\nA triangle is acute if all its internal angles are acute (< 90o). You are given a set of N points on a 2D plane. Calculate the number of acute triangles that can be formed using points from the set as vertices. \nTwo triangles are different if the set of three vertices of one triangle is not equal to the set of three vertices of the other triangle. \nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer N, the number of points in the set. Each of the next N lines contains two space separated integers which are the x and y coordinates of points in the set.\nOutput\nOutput a single line containing the number of acute triangles.\nConstraints\n\n 3 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 2000\n The x, y coordinate of each point satisfies 0 \xe2\x89\xa4 x, y \xe2\x89\xa4 10,000 \n All points are distinct. \n\nExample\nInput1:\n3\n0 0\n2 2\n0 3\nOutput1:\n1\nInput2:\n3\n0 0\n2 2\n0 5\nOutput2:\n0\nInput3:\n4\n1 1\n3 2\n1 3\n3 4\nOutput3:\n2\n\nExplanation\nExample case 3. Two acute triangles are {(1, 1), (3, 2), (1, 3)} and {(3, 2), (1, 3), (3, 4)}'
