b'Problem\n\xc2\xa0\nWhile developing Apps for Artificial Intelligence, Arush has to use specific type of strings (words) called Class C strings. \nAll the strings have been classified into 3 classes:\nClass A : A sequence of letters that read the same forward and backward.\nClass B : A string of class B can be converted to class A type by changing exactly one letter to a different letter.\nFor Example, CAT is class B type, since it can be changed to class A by either changing "C" to "T" or "T" to "C".\nNote that "SEES" is not a class B type, since changing one letter would not make it to a class A type.\nClass C : A string of class C is one that is formed by concatenating 2 strings of class B together. \nFor example, BATMAN is a class C type, since BAT and MAN both belong to class B type.\nGiven a list of words, help Arush determine which words belong to class C type and which do not.\n\xc2\xa0\nInput\n\nInput will consist of all uppercase words which will not be more than 25 characters in length.\nThe last word will be *END* which is not to be processed, it is just to mark the end of input.\n\n\xc2\xa0\nOutput\n\nFor each input, output "INPUT_STRING YES" if it is a class C type otherwise "INPUT_STRING NO" (without quotes).\n\n\xc2\xa0\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4  Length of each word  \xe2\x89\xa4 25\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExample\nInput:\nBATMAN\nSUPERMAN\n*END*\nOutput:\nBATMAN YES\nSUPERMAN NO\n\n\xc2\xa0\nExplanation\nExample case : Already Explained Above.'
