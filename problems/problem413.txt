b'Problem\nRichie Rich invited his best friend Mark to his mansion. Richie then showed him the room where he keeps his pocket money. There was a whole Mountain Range made of money inside the room. Mark could not believe his eyes. He asked Richie if he could take some of it. Richie said he could only take money from a Perfect Range of the mountain.\nGiven the height of the mountain range at n consecutive points i.e. x1,x2,x3.....xnx_1 , x_2 , x_3 ..... x_nx1\xe2\x80\x8b,x2\xe2\x80\x8b,x3\xe2\x80\x8b.....xn\xe2\x80\x8b, (Where xix_ixi\xe2\x80\x8b denotes the height of the mountain range at x=ix=ix=i) and m queries consisting of two integers lll and rrr ( l ll, rrr define a segment in the array of heights ), find for each query, whether the given segment of the mountain range is a Perfect Range.\nA Perfect Range of mountains contains exactly one peak.\nA range consisting of a peak will look like a_i &lt; a_{i+1} &lt; a_{i+2} ..... \\lt a_x &gt; a_{x+1} &gt; a_{x+2} .... \\gt a_j .

Else print NO.\nInput:\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer nnn denoting the number of points where the height sample has been taken.\nSecond-line contains nnn integers denoting the heights of the Mountain range.\nThe third line of input contains an integer mmm denoting the total number of queries.\nNext mmm lines following this, contains mmm queries, each line containing two integers lll and rrr, denoting the segment.\n\nOutput:\nFor each query, print Yes or No.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq n , m \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4n,m\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4l,r\xe2\x89\xa4n1 \\leq l , r \\leq n1\xe2\x89\xa4l,r\xe2\x89\xa4n\nl\xe2\x89\xa4rl \\leq r l\xe2\x89\xa4r\n0\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x89\xa41090 \\leq x_i \\leq 10^90\xe2\x89\xa4xi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSample Input:\n14\n10 9 8 7 5 6 5 4 3 4 5 6 7 8\n4\n1 4\n4 6\n5 7\n11 14\nSample Output:\nYES\nNO\nYES\nYES'
