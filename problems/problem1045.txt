b'Problem\nYou are given a binary string SSS of length NNN.\nYou have to perform the following operation exactly once:\n\nSelect an index iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N)(1 \\le i \\leq N)(1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N) and delete SiS_iSi\xe2\x80\x8b from SSS. The remaining parts of SSS are concatenated in the same order.\n\nHow many distinct binary strings of length N\xe2\x88\x921N-1N\xe2\x88\x921 can you get after applying this operation?\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer TTT - the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains NNN - the length of the binary string SSS.\nThe second line contains the binary string SSS.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each test case, output the number of distinct binary strings that you can get after applying the operation exactly once.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq T \\leq 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41052 \\leq N \\leq 10^52\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\nSum of NNN does not exceed 2\xe2\x8b\x851052 \\cdot 10^52\xe2\x8b\x85105 over all testcases.\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n3\n100\n4\n1111\n5\n101102\n1\n4\n\nExplanation:\nTest Case 1: We have S=100S = 100S=100. Now, we can get 000000 (on deleting S1S_1S1\xe2\x80\x8b), 101010 (on deleting S2S_2S2\xe2\x80\x8b) and 101010 (on deleting S3S_3S3\xe2\x80\x8b). Therefore, we can get 222 distinct strings.\nTest Case 2: We have S=1111S = 1111S=1111. Now, we will always get 111111111 irrespective of the index iii on which we apply the operation. Therefore, we can get 111 distinct string.'
