b'Problem\nBeing in the CodeChef College Chapter team, Chef thought of putting up a problem about palindromes. But he is unable to create a solution for it and asks for your help.\nYou will be given a string sss.\nYou have to find the longest palindrome which can be formed by elimination of consecutive letters from between. i.e. you need to delete characters from index iii to jjj where j\xe2\x89\xa5ij \\geq ij\xe2\x89\xa5i, i\xe2\x89\xa51i \\geq 1i\xe2\x89\xa51, j\xe2\x89\xa4nj \\leq nj\xe2\x89\xa4n (1 based indexing).\nPrint the longest palindrome possible after deleting a contiguous subsequence of length \xe2\x89\xa5\\geq\xe2\x89\xa5 0 from between.\nRules:\n\nYou cannot add any new characters.\nYou can not change order of the original string.\nAbsolute difference of number of characters chosen from beginning and number of characters chosen from end of the string in the palindrome should be \xe2\x89\xa41\\leq 1\xe2\x89\xa41.\n\nNote: If more than one answer is possible, print lexicographically smallest one.\n\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nEach testcase contains of a single line of input, a string sss.\n\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line the longest palindrome possible.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\leq T \\leq 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3s\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa41081 \\leq |s| \\leq 10^81\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3s\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4108\n\n\nSample Input:\n2\r\ndirvanirtomissionavrid\r\nfdnhhgiunuuntuaookslifunuighhndf\n\n\nSample Output:\ndirvaninavrid\r\nfdnhhgiunufunuighhndf\n\n\nEXPLANATION:\nIn test case 1, we delete characters from i=8i=8i=8 to j=16j=16j=16.\nIn test case 2, we delete characters from i=11i=11i=11 to j=21j=21j=21.'
