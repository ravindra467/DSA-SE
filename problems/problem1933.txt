b'Problem\nAs a bounty hunter, you have successfully earned a lot of bounties. While the galaxy was anticipating a clone war, Obi Wan Kenobi found the culprit behind the attempted assassination of Senator Amidala, and that you hired him.\nKenobi spotted you on Coruscant. His agility has kept him on your tail. You need to find a way to get away from him. To get away, you go to your clones and query for your perfect copy. After getting the lead, you successfully dodge Kenobi and go to Geonosis.\nConsider the grid of planets. As a bounty hunter, you cannot visit all the planets. You can go left, right, up and down. Kenobi damaged our navigation system, so the only way you can travel is by looking at adjacent planets.\nInput Format\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, the number of testcases.\nAfter each query, you must read a line containing two integers denoting the coordinates on the grid where you land. (Except after you output \xe2\x80\x9c! stay\xe2\x80\x9d) (If you cannot make a certain move, you stay at the same location)\n\nOutput Format\n\nTo make a query, you should print a line containing the character "?" (without quotes) and a string s(consisting of lowercase Latin alphabets).\nTo indicate the end of the interaction, output \xe2\x80\x9c! stay\xe2\x80\x9d (without quotes).\nAfter outputting each line, don\'t forget to flush the output.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa451\\leq T\\leq51\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45\nYou can make a maximum of 2500 queries per test case.\nGrid size is 20\xc3\x972020\\times2020\xc3\x9720\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n2 1\n2 2\n2 2? right\n? up\n? up\n! stay\nExplanation:\nFirst you read the number of test cases from the interactor.\nAssume that you start from position (1,1)(1,1)(1,1).\nNow you query right and two integers 2 and 1 are returned, denoting that you are now at (2,1)(2,1)(2,1).\nFor the third query, when you are at position (2,2)(2,2)(2,2), you query up and two integers 2 and 2 are returned, which means that the position (2,3)(2,3)(2,3) is blocked and hence, you do not move.\nFinally you output stay to indicate the end of the interaction.\nNote: This is just a sample denoting the interaction. The starting point, ending point may differ.'
