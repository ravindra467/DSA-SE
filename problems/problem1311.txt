Your task is to help Batman place the shards in such a way that the smallest distance between any two shards is the maximum possible. Find and output the same\nInput : \nFirst Line - N - number of free compartments\nSecond Line - S - number of shards\nThird Line - N values, the coordinates of each of these free compartments separated by a space\nOutput\nThe maximum minimum distance between two shards\nSample Input\n5\n3\n1 4 2 9 8\nSample Output\n3\nExplanation - He can keep the shards at 1, 4 and (8 or 9) giving the maximum minimum distance as 3.'
