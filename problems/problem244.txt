These cities are numbered 111 through NNN and connected by MMM bidirectional roads. Each city can be reached from every other city using these roads.\nInitially, Ryan is in city 111. At each of the following KKK seconds, he may move from his current city to an adjacent city (a city connected by a road to his current city) or stay at his current city. Ryan also has QQQ conditions (a1,b1),(a2,b2),\xe2\x80\xa6,(aQ,bQ)(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \\ldots, (a_Q, b_Q)(a1\xe2\x80\x8b,b1\xe2\x80\x8b),(a2\xe2\x80\x8b,b2\xe2\x80\x8b),\xe2\x80\xa6,(aQ\xe2\x80\x8b,bQ\xe2\x80\x8b) meaning that during this KKK-second trip, for each valid iii, he wants to be in city aia_iai\xe2\x80\x8b after exactly bib_ibi\xe2\x80\x8b seconds.\nSince you are very good with directions, Ryan asked you to tell him how many different trips he could make while satisfying all conditions. Compute this number modulo 109+710^9 + 7109+7. A trip is a sequence of Ryan's current cities after 1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,K1, 2, \\ldots, K1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,K seconds.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NNN, MMM and KKK.\nEach of the next MMM lines contains two space-separated integers uuu and vvv denoting a road between cities uuu and vvv.\nThe next line contains a single integer QQQ.\nQQQ lines follow. For each iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4Q1 \\le i \\le Q1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4Q), the iii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers aia_iai\xe2\x80\x8b and bib_ibi\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x94 the number of trips Ryan can make, modulo 109+710^9+7109+7.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4501 \\le T \\le 501\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa450\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M,K,Q\xe2\x89\xa49,0001 \\le N, M, K, Q \\le 9,0001\xe2\x89\xa4N,M,K,Q\xe2\x89\xa49,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ui,vi\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le u_i, v_i \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4ui\xe2\x80\x8b,vi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid iii\nui\xe2\x89\xa0viu_i \\neq v_iui\xe2\x80\x8b\xee\x80\xa0=vi\xe2\x80\x8b for each valid iii\nthere is at most one road between each pair of cities\neach city is reachable from every other city\n1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le a_i \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4N for each valid iii\n0\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x89\xa4K0 \\le b_i \\le K0\xe2\x89\xa4bi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4K for each valid iii\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 9,0009,0009,000\nthe sum of KKK over all test cases does not exceed 9,0009,0009,000\nthe sum of MMM over all test cases does not exceed 9,0009,0009,000\nthe sum of QQQ over all test cases does not exceed 9,0009,0009,000\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (20 points):\n\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 400400400\nthe sum of KKK over all test cases does not exceed 400400400\nthe sum of MMM over all test cases does not exceed 400400400\nthe sum of QQQ over all test cases does not exceed 400400400\n\nSubtask #2 (80 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n4 3 3\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n0\n4 3 3\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n1\n2 2\n4 3 3\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n1\n2 128\n4\n6"
