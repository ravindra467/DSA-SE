It can be viewed as a grid with a fixed width NNN (with NNN columns numbered 111 through NNN) and changing height. The rows of the grid are numbered with positive integers. Each cell in Chefland has a colour, which is either '0' or '1'.\nFrom a cell (x,y)(x, y)(x,y), it is possible to move to one of the cells (x+1,y\xe2\x88\x921)(x+1, y-1)(x+1,y\xe2\x88\x921), (x+1,y)(x+1, y)(x+1,y) and (x+1,y+1)(x+1, y+1)(x+1,y+1), but only if the destination cell exists and has the same colour as the origin cell.\nIn Chefland, rows sometimes appear or disappear. However, a row may only appear at the bottom of the grid or disappear if it was at the top of the grid; whenever that happens, rows are renumbered with positive integers from top to bottom in such a way that the topmost row has number 111.\nNow, Chef received a difficult task \xe2\x80\x95 keeping track of the number of ways to move from the topmost row to the bottommost row. He is asking you to help him answer QQQ queries. Initially, the grid is empty \xe2\x80\x95 it has 000 rows. There are three types of queries:\n\nadd L: You are given a string LLL with length NNN. A new row appears; for each valid iii, the colour of the cell in this row and the iii-th column is LiL_iLi\xe2\x80\x8b.\nremove: The topmost row disappears.\npath c d: Find the number of paths starting in the cell in the topmost row and ccc-th column and ending in the cell in the bottommost row and ddd-th column. Two paths are considered different if there is a cell which is visited in one path, but not in the other. Since this number can be very big, compute it modulo 1,000,000,0071,000,000,0071,000,000,007.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers NNN and QQQ.\nEach of the following QQQ lines describes a query in the format described above.\n\nOutput\nFor each path query, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the number of paths modulo 1,000,000,0071,000,000,0071,000,000,007.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4201 \\le N \\le 201\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa420\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4300,0001 \\le Q \\le 300,0001\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4300,000\n\xe2\x88\xa3L\xe2\x88\xa3=N|L| = N\xe2\x88\xa3L\xe2\x88\xa3=N\nLLL contains only characters '0' and '1'\n1\xe2\x89\xa4c,d\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le c, d \\le N1\xe2\x89\xa4c,d\xe2\x89\xa4N\nfor each path or remove query, the grid is not empty\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (10 points):\n\nN\xe2\x89\xa410N \\le 10N\xe2\x89\xa410\nQ\xe2\x89\xa4300Q \\le 300Q\xe2\x89\xa4300\n\nSubtask #2 (30 points):\n\nN\xe2\x89\xa410N \\le 10N\xe2\x89\xa410\nQ\xe2\x89\xa430,000Q \\le 30,000Q\xe2\x89\xa430,000\n\nSubtask #3 (60 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput5 9\nadd 11101\npath 1 2\nadd 01110\npath 3 2\nadd 00100\npath 3 3\nadd 10110\nremove\npath 1 20\n1\n3\n2\nExplanation:\nAfter the first query, the city is:\n11101\n\nThere is no way to move from column 111 to column 222.\nAfter the third query, the city is:\n11101\r\n01110\n\nThere is only one way to move from the cell (1,3)(1, 3)(1,3) to the cell (2,2)(2, 2)(2,2): (1,3)\xe2\x86\x92(2,2)(1, 3) \\rightarrow (2, 2)(1,3)\xe2\x86\x92(2,2).\nAfter the fifth query, the city is:\n11101\r\n01110\r\n00100\n\nThere are 333 ways to move from the cell (1,3)(1, 3)(1,3) to the cell (3,3)(3, 3)(3,3):\n\n(1,3)\xe2\x86\x92(2,2)\xe2\x86\x92(3,3)(1, 3) \\rightarrow (2, 2) \\rightarrow (3, 3)(1,3)\xe2\x86\x92(2,2)\xe2\x86\x92(3,3)\n(1,3)\xe2\x86\x92(2,3)\xe2\x86\x92(3,3)(1, 3) \\rightarrow (2, 3) \\rightarrow (3, 3)(1,3)\xe2\x86\x92(2,3)\xe2\x86\x92(3,3)\n(1,3)\xe2\x86\x92(2,4)\xe2\x86\x92(3,3)(1, 3) \\rightarrow (2, 4) \\rightarrow (3, 3)(1,3)\xe2\x86\x92(2,4)\xe2\x86\x92(3,3)\n\nAfter the eighth query, the city is:\n01110\r\n00100\r\n10110\n\nThere are 222 ways to move from the cell (1,1)(1, 1)(1,1) to the cell (3,2)(3, 2)(3,2):\n\n(1,1)\xe2\x86\x92(2,1)\xe2\x86\x92(3,2)(1, 1) \\rightarrow (2, 1) \\rightarrow (3, 2)(1,1)\xe2\x86\x92(2,1)\xe2\x86\x92(3,2)\n(1,1)\xe2\x86\x92(2,2)\xe2\x86\x92(3,2)(1, 1) \\rightarrow (2, 2) \\rightarrow (3, 2)(1,1)\xe2\x86\x92(2,2)\xe2\x86\x92(3,2)\n"
