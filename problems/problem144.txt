b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Russian, Mandarin Chinese, Bengali, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef's school semester lasts for nnn days. Chef's teacher gives the students some homework every day and it is compulsory to turn in the homework by the very next day. Chef knows that the number of minutes needed to complete the homework on the iii-th day is HiH_iHi\xe2\x80\x8b.\nChef hates homework and wants to spend the minimum amount of time possible in doing homework. Luckily, he has a few tricks up his sleeve. Chef can hack the school records on any given day to make it show that the assigned homework is complete. However to avoid suspicion, Chef will not hack the records strictly more than kkk days consecutively.\nCan you help Chef find the minimum possible total number of minutes that Chef needs to spend on homework?\nNote:\n\nThere are multiple test cases in a single file, refer to Input section for more details.\nSince the input is large, it is recommended to use fast input/output methods.\n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line contains a single integer TTT, the number of test cases. The description of the TTT test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers nnn and kkk - the number of days in Chef's semester and the maximum number of consecutive days Chef can hack the school's record system.\nThe second line of each test case contains nnn integers, H1,H2,\xe2\x80\xa6HnH_1, H_2, \\dots H_nH1\xe2\x80\x8b,H2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6Hn\xe2\x80\x8b, where HiH_iHi\xe2\x80\x8b is the number of minutes Chef needs to complete the homework given on the iii-th day.\n\nOutput Format\n\nFor each test case, print a single line containing an integer, the minimum number of minutes Chef needs to spend on homework.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\leq T \\leq 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\leq n \\leq 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4106\n1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n1 \\leq k \\leq n1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4n\n0\xe2\x89\xa4Hi\xe2\x89\xa41030 \\leq H_i \\leq 10^30\xe2\x89\xa4Hi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4103 for all 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n1 \\leq i \\leq n1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n\nThe sum of nnn over all test cases is at most 10610^6106\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n7 3\n213 124 156 263 149 6 62\n7 1\n476 457 232 130 849 95 749\n7 2\n601 35 45 304 449 452 190130\n682\n484\nExplanation:\n\n\nIn the first test case, Chef does his homework on days 222 and 666, taking a total of H2+H6=124+6=130H_2 + H_6 = 124 + 6 = 130H2\xe2\x80\x8b+H6\xe2\x80\x8b=124+6=130 minutes. The maximum number of consecutive days that Chef hacks is 333 (days 333, 444, and 555), which is not more than k=3k=3k=3.\n\n\nIn the second test case, Chef does his homework on days 222, 444, and 666, taking a total of H2+H4+H6=457+130+95=682H_2 + H_4 + H_6 = 457 + 130 + 95 = 682H2\xe2\x80\x8b+H4\xe2\x80\x8b+H6\xe2\x80\x8b=457+130+95=682 minutes.\n\n\nIn the third test case, Chef does his homework on days 222 and 555, taking a total of H2+H5=35+449=484H_2 + H_5 = 35 + 449 = 484H2\xe2\x80\x8b+H5\xe2\x80\x8b=35+449=484 minutes.\n\n\nYou can verify that these are indeed the optimal solutions."
