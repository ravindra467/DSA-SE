Cooking skill of a team is the sum of the cooking skills of its cooks.\nThere are NNN participants for the contest,each with cooking skill AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b.\nChef has to make the necessary arrangements for the contest , so you have to help him to find out the maximum no. of teams which can be formed.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\nEach testcase contains two line of input, two integers N,KN, KN,K.\nThe next line contains NNN space separated integers AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b denoting the cooking skill of ithi^{th}ith participant.\n\nOutput:\nFor each testcase, output in a single line the maximum no. of teams that can participate in the contest.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq T \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41052 \\leq N \\leq 10^52\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41092 \\leq K \\leq 10^92\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109\n\nSample Input:\n2\n4 5\n1 3 4 2\n3 4\n2 1 4\nSample Output:\n2\n0\nEXPLANATION:\nTestCase1:Test Case 1 : TestCase1:\nClearly 1st1^{st}1st & 3rd3^{rd}3rd participant and 2nd2^{nd}2nd & 4th4^{th}4th can form the team.\nSo 222 teams are formed.'
