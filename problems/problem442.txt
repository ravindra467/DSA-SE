b'Problem\nThere are KKK travellers who want to travel through a country one after the other. The country is in the form of a 222-d grid and is divided into NNN rows and MMM columns, such that each cell of the grid can be considered to be a city.\nEach city is initially marked with either 0 or 1. Let city (i,j)(i,j)(i,j) (the city at the intersection of the ithi^{th}ith row and jthj^{th}jth column) be marked with number CijC_{ij}Cij\xe2\x80\x8b. If a traveller is in the city (i,j)(i,j)(i,j), then\n\nIf Cij=0C_{ij} = 0Cij\xe2\x80\x8b=0 and j<Mj \\lt Mj<M, then the traveller moves to city (i,j+1)(i,j+1)(i,j+1) and at the same time CijC_{ij}Cij\xe2\x80\x8b is changed to 111.\nIf Cij=1C_{ij} = 1Cij\xe2\x80\x8b=1 and i<Ni \\lt Ni<N, then the traveller moves to city (i+1,j)(i+1,j)(i+1,j) and at the same time CijC_{ij}Cij\xe2\x80\x8b is changed to 000.\n\nIf the traveller cannot make a move from a city (i,j)(i,j)(i,j), then this city is considered to be the destination of that traveller. Note that the marking (CijC_{ij}Cij\xe2\x80\x8b) of the destination cell is unchanged \xe2\x80\x94 please see the third sample test for an explained example.\nEach traveller starts their journey from city (1,1)(1,1)(1,1), and all travellers (apart from the first) start their journey only once the previous one has reached their destination. Find the destination city of the KKK-th traveller.\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer TTT, denoting the number of testcases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each testcase contains three space-separated integers N,MN, MN,M, and KKK \xe2\x80\x94 the number of rows, number of columns, and number of travellers, respectively.\nThe following NNN lines each contain a binary string of length MMM, such that jjj-th character of the iii-th string denotes the initial marking of city (i,j)(i,j)(i,j), CijC_{ij}Cij\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput Format\nFor each testcase, output in a single line two space-separated integers xxx and yyy, where city (x,y)(x,y)(x,y) is the destination city of the KKK-th traveller.\nConstraints\n\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq T \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41000\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41052 \\leq N, M \\leq 10^52\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4105\nN\xe2\x8b\x85M\xe2\x89\xa44\xe2\x8b\x85105N \\cdot M \\leq 4\\cdot 10^5N\xe2\x8b\x85M\xe2\x89\xa44\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq K \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4109\nSum of N\xe2\x8b\x85MN\\cdot MN\xe2\x8b\x85M over all tescases does not exceed 4\xe2\x8b\x851054\\cdot 10^54\xe2\x8b\x85105.\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput3\n2 2 1\n10\n01\n2 2 1\n10\n10\n2 2 2\n11\n10\n2 2\n2 1\n2 2\n\nExplanation:\nTest case 111: The first (and only) traveller moves along the following path: (1,1)\xe2\x86\x92(2,1)\xe2\x86\x92(2,2)(1, 1) \\rightarrow (2, 1) \\rightarrow (2, 2)(1,1)\xe2\x86\x92(2,1)\xe2\x86\x92(2,2).\nTest case 222: The traveller moves along the following path: (1,1)\xe2\x86\x92(2,1)(1, 1) \\rightarrow (2, 1)(1,1)\xe2\x86\x92(2,1).

After this, the state of city (1,1)(1, 1)(1,1) changes to 000 while the states of the other cities remain unchanged.\nThe second traveller then moves along the path (1,1)\xe2\x86\x92(1,2)\xe2\x86\x92(2,2)(1, 1) \\rightarrow (1, 2) \\rightarrow (2, 2)(1,1)\xe2\x86\x92(1,2)\xe2\x86\x92(2,2).'
