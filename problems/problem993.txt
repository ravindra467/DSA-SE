b'Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.\n\nGiven a string S. You need to find a substring which satisfies the following conditions and output its start and end positions in the string S.\n\nHas exactly x different characters in it.\nLength of substring is atleast minLength and atmost maxLength.\nsubstring\'s start position is greater than or equal to L.\nsubstring\'s end position is less than or equal to R.\n\n\nIf there are multiple substrings that satisfy above conditions, choose the one that has least start position. If there are still multiple substrings, choose the one that has least end position. See output section for more details\n\nInput\n\nFirst line of input contains the string S\nThe second line of the input contains an integer Q denoting the number of queries.\nOnly line of each query contains 5 space separated integers, x, minLength, maxLength, L, R\nOutput\nFor each query, output one line with 2 space separated integers, start and end positions of substring in S. If there is no valid solution output "-1 -1" instead\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 |S| (Length of S) \xe2\x89\xa4 10^5\nS contains only lower case english alphabet (\'a\' - \'z\')\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Q \xe2\x89\xa4 10^5\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 x \xe2\x89\xa4 26\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 minLength \xe2\x89\xa4 maxLength \xe2\x89\xa4 |S|\n0 \xe2\x89\xa4 L \xe2\x89\xa4 R \xe2\x89\xa4 |S|-1\n\nExample\nInput\nabcc\n3\n2 1 3 0 3\n2 3 3 0 3\n1 2 2 0 2\nOutput\n0 1\n1 3\n-1 -1\nExplanation\n\nTestcase #1\nWe need a substring with 2 different characters, of length 1 or 2 or 3 and in between S[0..3].\nS[0..1] = "ab", which has 2 different characters, length 2, and is in between S[0..3]\n\n\nTestcase #2\nHere we need the length to be 3.\nS[1..3] = "bcc", has 2 different characters, length 3, and is in between S[0..3]\n'
