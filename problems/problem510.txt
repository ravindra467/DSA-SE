b'Problem\nAfter a thrilling but exhausting journey of monster hunting, the White Wolf has decided to return to Kaer Morhen. He needs to reach his destination by crossing a N\xc3\x97MN\\times MN\xc3\x97M grid that contains at most one monster in each cell. His current location is at cell (1,1)(1,1)(1,1) and his destination lies in the cell (N,M)(N,M)(N,M). In every step, he is allowed to move 111 cell to the right or 111 cell downwards only.  Also, he cannot move outside the grid.\nThe White Wolf has an initial health points of PPP points. Each time he fights with a monster, his health points decrease by XXX. If at any point in time, the total health points become less than or equal to 000, the White Wolf will immediately die and will never reach his destination.\nBut that\'s not the end of the story. There are some special herbs placed in some cells throughout the grid (at most one in each cell). His health points will increase by YYY points if he uses a herb. It is guaranteed that there is no cell such that a monster and a herb will be at the same cell. It is also guaranteed that there are no herbs or monsters at the starting and destination cells.\nYour task is to determine the maximum possible health points the White Wolf can have when he reaches Kaer Morhen. Otherwise, determine that it\'s impossible to reach his destination.\nInput:\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, the number of test cases. Then the  TTT test cases follow.\nFirst line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and MMM.\nSecond line of each test case contains three space-separated integers P,XP,XP,X and YYY.\nThen follows NNN lines of input, each containing a string a length MMM, representing the grid. Each character on the grid is either a 000 representing an empty cell, a 111 representing a monster, or a 222 representing a herb.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, output in a single line "\xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921" if it is not possible to reach the destination. Otherwise, print in a single line the required answer.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq T \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq N,M \\leq 1001\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4P,X,Y\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\leq P,X,Y \\leq 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4P,X,Y\xe2\x89\xa4109\nAll characters in the grid are 0,10,10,1 or 222 only.\nThe top-left and the bottom-right cells contain the character 000, i.e., they are empty.\n\nSample Input:\n2\n4 2\n78 16 94\n01\n10\n01\n20\n3 1\n60 64 27\n0\n1\n0\nSample Output:\n156\n-1'
