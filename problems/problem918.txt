b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Hindi, Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nChef works as a cook in a restaurant. Each morning, he has to drive down a straight road with length KKK to reach the restaurant from his home. Let's describe this road using a coordinate XXX; the position of Chef's home is X=0X = 0X=0 and the position of the restaurant is X=KX = KX=K.\nThe road has exactly two lanes (numbered 111 and 222), but there are NNN obstacles (numbered 111 through NNN) on it. For each valid iii, the iii-th obstacle blocks the lane LiL_iLi\xe2\x80\x8b at the position X=XiX = X_iX=Xi\xe2\x80\x8b and does not block the other lane.\nWhen driving, Chef cannot pass through an obstacle. He can switch lanes in zero time at any integer XXX-coordinate which does not coincide with the XXX-coordinate of any obstacle. However, whenever he switches lanes, he cannot switch again until driving for at least DDD units of distance, and he can travel only in the direction of increasing XXX. Chef can start driving in any lane he wants. He can not switch lanes at non-integer  XXX-coordinate.\nSometimes, it is impossible to reach the restaurant without stopping at an obstacle. Find the maximum possible distance Chef can travel before he has to reach an obstacle which is in the same lane as him. If he can avoid all obstacles and reach the restaurant, the answer is KKK.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers NNN, KKK and DDD.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers X1,X2,\xe2\x80\xa6,XNX_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_NX1\xe2\x80\x8b,X2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,XN\xe2\x80\x8b.\nThe third line contains NNN space-separated integers L1,L2,\xe2\x80\xa6,LNL_1, L_2, \\ldots, L_NL1\xe2\x80\x8b,L2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,LN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing one integer \xe2\x80\x95 the maximum distance Chef can travel.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,0001 \\le T \\le 1,0001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41,000\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le N \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4105\n2\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41092 \\le K \\le 10^92\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\le D \\le 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4D\xe2\x89\xa4109\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Xi\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x88\x9211 \\le X_i \\le K-11\xe2\x89\xa4Xi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x88\x921 for each valid iii\nXi<Xi+1X_i \\lt X_{i+1}Xi\xe2\x80\x8b<Xi+1\xe2\x80\x8b for each valid iii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Li\xe2\x89\xa421 \\le L_i \\le 21\xe2\x89\xa4Li\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa42 for each valid iii\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 10610^6106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4\n2 10 20\n4 7\n1 2\n4 15 20\n4 6 9 13\n1 2 2 1\n5 10 1\n1 3 5 7 9\n1 2 1 2 1\n2 10 2\n4 5\n1 210\n13\n10\n5\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: Chef can start in lane 222 and switch to lane 111 at the position X=6X = 6X=6, then continue until reaching the restaurant.\nExample case 2: Chef can start in lane 222 and switch to lane 111 at X=5X = 5X=5. However, he cannot avoid the obstacle at X=13X = 13X=13, because he has not driven for at least 202020 units since the last switch.\nExample case 3: Chef should start in lane 222 and then switch lanes at the positions X=2X=2X=2, X=4X=4X=4, X=6X=6X=6 and X=8X=8X=8. This way, he can reach the restaurant.\nExample case 4: Chef can start in lane 222 but he cannot escape the second obstacle at XXX=5 since the first obstacle at XXX=4 doesn't give enough space for Chef to switch lanes."
