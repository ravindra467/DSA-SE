b"Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef found a strange string yesterday - a string of signs s, where each sign is either a '<', '=' or a '>'. Let N be the length of this string. Chef wants to insert N + 1 positive integers into this sequence and make it valid. A valid sequence is a sequence where every sign is preceded and followed by an integer, and the signs are correct. That is, if a sign '<' is preceded by the integer a and followed by an integer b, then a should be less than b. Likewise for the other two signs as well. \nChef can take some positive integers in the range [1, P] and use a number in the range as many times as he wants.\nHelp Chef find the minimum possible P with which he can create a valid sequence.\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe only line of each test case contains the string of signs s, where each sign is either '<', '=' or a '>'. \nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the minimum possible P. \nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T, |s| \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Sum of |s| over all test cases in a single test file \xe2\x89\xa4 106\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points)\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T, |s| \xe2\x89\xa4 103\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Sum of |s| over all test cases in a single test file \xe2\x89\xa4 104\n\n\nSubtask #2 (70 points)\n\nOriginal constraints\n\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput4\n<<<\n<><\n<=>\n<=<4\n2\n2\n3\nExplanation:\nHere are some possible valid sequences which can be formed with the minimum P for each of the test cases:\n1 < 2 < 3 < 4\n1 < 2 > 1 < 2\n1 < 2 = 2 > 1\n1 < 2 = 2 < 3\n"
