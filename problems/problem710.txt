Length of i-th stick is Ai. \nChef asks his brother to choose any four sticks and to make a rectangle with those sticks its sides. Chef warns his brother to not to break any of the sticks, he has to use sticks as a whole. Also, he wants that the rectangle formed should have the maximum possible area among all the rectangles that Chef's brother can make. \n\n\nChef's little brother takes this challenge up and overcomes it. Can you also do so? That is, you have to tell whether it is even possible to create a rectangle? If yes, then you have to tell the maximum possible area of rectangle.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test-cases. T test cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of sticks.\nThe second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the lengths of sticks.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing an integer representing the maximum possible area for rectangle or -1 if it's impossible to form any rectangle using the available sticks.\nConstraints\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 103\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 sum of N's over all test-cases in a single test file \xe2\x89\xa4 103\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Ai \xe2\x89\xa4 103\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n5\n1 2 3 1 2\n4\n1 2 2 32\n-1\nExplanation:\nExample case 1.
