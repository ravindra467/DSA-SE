b"Problem\nRead problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.\nYou are given a string AAA of length NNN, consisting of zeroes and ones. You want to partition it into blocks consisting of consecutive indices such that each block has an odd sum and has length at most mmm. For each mmm from 111 to NNN, find the minimum number of blocks required, or report that it is impossible.\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer TTT, the number of test cases. Each test case contains two lines:\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer NNN.\nThe second line of each test case contains a string A=a1a2\xe2\x80\xa6aNA=a_1 a_2 \\ldots a_NA=a1\xe2\x80\x8ba2\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\xa6aN\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print NNN space-separated integers. The mmm-th of these integers should be the minimum number of blocks of length at most mmm the array can be partitioned into, such that each block has an odd sum, or \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 if it is impossible to do so.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\le N\\le 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4106\nThe sum of NNN over all test cases doesn't exceed 10610^6106.\n\nSubtasks\n\nSubtask 1 (9 Points): The sum of NNN over all test cases doesn't exceed 200200200.\nSubtask 2 (13 Points): The sum of NNN over all test cases doesn't exceed 250025002500.\nSubtask 3 (21 Points): The sum of NNN over all test cases doesn't exceed 150001500015000.\nSubtask 4 (17 Points): The sum of NNN over all test cases doesn't exceed 500005000050000.\nSubtask 5 (24 Points): The sum of NNN over all test cases doesn't exceed 250000250000250000.\nSubtask 6 (16 Points): No additional constraints.\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n5\n01101-1 3 3 3 1\nExplanation:\nClearly if m=1m = 1m=1, no such partitioning is possible, as the first block must consist of a single 000.\nFor m=2,3,4m = 2, 3, 4m=2,3,4, we can partition it as 01101\\boxed{01}\\boxed{10} \\boxed{1}01\xe2\x80\x8b10\xe2\x80\x8b1\xe2\x80\x8b.
