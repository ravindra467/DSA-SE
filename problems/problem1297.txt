b"Problem\nRead problems statements in Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Bengali as well.\nTwo arrays AAA and BBB of size NNN are equivalent if for every (i,j)(i,j)(i,j) (1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4N)(1 \\le i \\lt j \\le N)(1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4N), Bi=BjB_i = B_jBi\xe2\x80\x8b=Bj\xe2\x80\x8b if and only if Ai=AjA_i = A_jAi\xe2\x80\x8b=Aj\xe2\x80\x8b. For example, [1,2,2][1,2,2][1,2,2], [10,11,11][10,11,11][10,11,11], [5,1,1][5,1,1][5,1,1] are equivalent, while [1,2,3,1][1,2,3,1][1,2,3,1], [10,20,10,10][10,20,10,10][10,20,10,10] are not.\nThere is a hidden array of NNN integers, where the elements are numbered from A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\dots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b. Your task is to guess any array which is equivalent to the hidden array by asking the following query at most QQQ times. The elements of the guessed array must be within the range [1,109][1,10^{9}][1,109].\nIn each query, you give a subset of indices {i1,i2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ik}\\{i_1,i_2,\\dots,i_k\\}{i1\xe2\x80\x8b,i2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,ik\xe2\x80\x8b} in the array i.e some subset of {1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,N}\\{1,2,\\dots,N\\}{1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,N} and the judge returns the frequency of most frequent element among {Ai1,Ai2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Aik}\\{A_{i_1}, A_{i_2}, \\dots, A_{i_k}\\}{Ai1\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b,Ai2\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,Aik\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8b}. Note that the indices must be distinct and the order doesn't matter.\nFor example, consider the array [10,3,1,10,1,1,3][10,3,1,10,1,1,3][10,3,1,10,1,1,3].\n\nThe ouput of query {2,3,4,7}\\{2,3,4,7\\}{2,3,4,7} is 222. (333 occurs maximum number of times i.e 222 times)\nOuput of query {2,3,1,4,5}\\{2,3,1,4,5\\}{2,3,1,4,5} is 222. (Both 111 and 101010 occur 222 times)\n\nInteraction\nFirst, you should read the number of test cases TTT.\nFor each test case, you should read two integers NNN and QQQ.\nThen you may ask questions:\n\nOutput ??? followed by an integer denoting the number of elements in subset followed by the indices ?ki1i2\xe2\x80\xa6ik? k i_1 i_2 \\dots i_k?ki1\xe2\x80\x8bi2\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\xa6ik\xe2\x80\x8b.\nRead an integer xxx denoting the answer to your query.\nIf the query was invalid or you have exceeded the query limit, judge prints '-1' and exits with wrong answer verdict. In this case, you must also terminate your program.\n\nWhen you have determined the answer, print the character !!! followed by NNN space-separated integers denoting the array !A1A2\xe2\x80\xa6AN! A_1 A_2 \\dots A_N!A1\xe2\x80\x8bA2\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\xa6AN\xe2\x80\x8b. Note that this does not count towards a query.\nNow you must read an integer denoting that your answer is correct or not.\n\nIf your answer is correct, judge prints '1'. In this case, you should continue solving the remaining test cases.\nIf your answer is incorrect, judge prints '-1' and exits with wrong answer verdict. You must also terminate your program in this case otherwise, you may receive any verdict.\n\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq T \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41002 \\leq N \\leq 1002\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\nQ=6NQ = 6NQ=6N\nFor the given constraints, it is guaranteed that the answer can be found in the given number of queries.\n\nSample interaction\nYou       Grader\n          1\n          3 18\n? 2 1 2\n          1\n? 3 1 2 3 \n          2\n? 2 2 3\n          1\n? 2 1 3\n          2\n! 3 4 3\n          1\n### Explanation\nThe hidden array was AAA = [10,20,10][10,20,10][10,20,10].\n\nWe ask a query for subset {1,2}\\{1,2\\}{1,2}. The grader responds with 111 since both 101010 and 202020 occur 111 time.\nThen we query for {1,2,3}\\{1,2,3\\}{1,2,3}. The grader responds with 222 because frequency of 101010 is 222.\nThen we query for {2,3}\\{2,3\\}{2,3}. Grader responds with 111 since both elements are distinct.\nLastly we query for {1,3}\\{1,3\\}{1,3} and the grader responds with 222 i.e frequency of 101010.\n"
