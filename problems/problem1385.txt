b'Problem\n\nThe Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv likes lucky digits. Everybody knows that the lucky digits are digits 4 and 7.\n\n\nThis time he has an array A that consists of N integers: A[1], A[2], ..., A[N]. Let F4(x) be the number of digits 4 in the decimal representation of x, and F7(x) be the number of digits 7 in the decimal representation of x. For example, F4(5) = 0, F4(4467) = 2 and F7(457747) = 3.\n\n\nConsider some pair of integers L and R such that 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 L \xe2\x89\xa4 R \xe2\x89\xa4 N. Let C4 be the total number of digits 4 in decimal representation of integers A[L], A[L + 1] ..., A[R], i. e.,\n\n\nC4 = F4(A[L]) + F4(A[L + 1]) + ... + F4(A[R]).\n\n\nSimilarly, let C7 be the the total number of digits 7 in decimal representation of integers A[L], A[L + 1] ..., A[R], i. e.,\n\n\nC7 = F7(A[L]) + F7(A[L + 1]) + ... + F7(A[R]).\n\n\nThe Little Elephant wants to know the number of such pairs (L; R) for which C4C7 \xe2\x89\xa4 R \xe2\x88\x92 L + 1. But he believes that the number 2 is unlucky. Hence he discards all pairs where C4 = 2 or C7 = 2.\n\n\nHelp the Little Elephant to find the answer for the problem.\n\n\nRemark. 00 = 1. It is a standard mathematical definition.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N, the size of the array A for the corresponding test case. The second line contains N space separated integers A[1], A[2], ..., A[N].\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case output a single line containing the answer for the corresponding test case.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 3 \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105 \n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 A[i] \xe2\x89\xa4 109\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n3\n1 2 1\n4\n47 2 4 77548\n1\n777\n\n\nOutput:\n6\n5\n1\n\nExplanation\n\nCase 1. Here C4 = C7 = 0 for all pairs (L; R). So 00 = 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 R \xe2\x88\x92 L + 1 for each pair. There are 6 pairs (L; R) in all: (1; 1), (1; 2), (1; 3), (2; 2), (2; 3), (3; 3). So the answer is 6.\n\n\nCase 2. Here we have 10 pairs of (L; R) in all. Consider them all.\n\n\n\n L = 1, R = 1: C4 = 1, C7 = 1, C4C7 = 11 = 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 1 = R \xe2\x88\x92 L + 1. The pair is counted.\n L = 1, R = 2: C4 = 1, C7 = 1, C4C7 = 11 = 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 2 = R \xe2\x88\x92 L + 1. The pair is counted.\n L = 1, R = 3: C4 = 2, C7 = 1, C4C7 = 21 = 2 \xe2\x89\xa4 3 = R \xe2\x88\x92 L + 1. But the pair is not counted since C4 = 2.\n L = 1, R = 4: C4 = 3, C7 = 3, C4C7 = 33 = 27 > 4 = R \xe2\x88\x92 L + 1. The pair is not counted.\n L = 2, R = 2: C4 = 0, C7 = 0, C4C7 = 00 = 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 1 = R \xe2\x88\x92 L + 1. The pair is counted.\n L = 2, R = 3: C4 = 1, C7 = 0, C4C7 = 10 = 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 2 = R \xe2\x88\x92 L + 1. The pair is counted.\n L = 2, R = 4: C4 = 2, C7 = 2, C4C7 = 22 = 4 > 3 = R \xe2\x88\x92 L + 1. The pair is not counted. It is also not counted since C4 = 2, and also since C7 = 2.\n L = 3, R = 3: C4 = 1, C7 = 0, C4C7 = 10 = 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 1 = R \xe2\x88\x92 L + 1. The pair is counted.\n L = 3, R = 4: C4 = 2, C7 = 2, C4C7 = 22 = 4 > 2 = R \xe2\x88\x92 L + 1. The pair is not counted. It is also not counted since C4 = 2, and also since C7 = 2.\n L = 4, R = 4: C4 = 1, C7 = 2, C4C7 = 12 = 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 1 = R \xe2\x88\x92 L + 1. But the pair is not counted since C7 = 2.\n\n\n\nAs we see there are exactly 5 pairs (L; R) that satisfy required constraints.\n\n\nCase 3. Here we have the only pair (L; R) = (1; 1) for which C4 = 0, C7 = 3 and C4C7 = 03 = 0 \xe2\x89\xa4 1 = R \xe2\x88\x92 L + 1. So it is counted, and the answer is 1.\n'
