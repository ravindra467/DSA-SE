b"Problem\nRead problems statements Bengali , Mandarin chinese , Russian and Vietnamese as well.\nChef is a cook and he has recently opened a restaurant.\nThe restaurant is open during NNN time intervals [L1,R1),[L2,R2),\xe2\x80\xa6,[LN,RN)[L_1, R_1), [L_2, R_2), \\dots, [L_N, R_N)[L1\xe2\x80\x8b,R1\xe2\x80\x8b),[L2\xe2\x80\x8b,R2\xe2\x80\x8b),\xe2\x80\xa6,[LN\xe2\x80\x8b,RN\xe2\x80\x8b).

If the restaurant is open at that time, this person does not have to wait, but if it is closed, this person will wait until it is open. Note that if this person arrives at an exact time when the restaurant is closing, they have to wait for the next opening time.\nFor each person, calculate how long they have to wait (possibly 000 time), or determine that they will wait forever for the restaurant to open.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers NNN and MMM.\nNNN lines follow. For each valid iii, the iii-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers LiL_iLi\xe2\x80\x8b and RiR_iRi\xe2\x80\x8b.\nMMM lines follow. For each valid iii, the iii-th of these lines contains a single integer PiP_iPi\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print MMM lines. For each valid iii, the iii-th of these lines should contain a single integer \xe2\x80\x94 the time person iii has to wait, or \xe2\x88\x921-1\xe2\x88\x921 if person iii has to wait forever.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le T \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\le N, M \\le 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N,M\xe2\x89\xa4105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Li<Ri\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\le L_i \\lt R_i \\le 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Li\xe2\x80\x8b<Ri\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid iii\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa41091 \\le P_i \\le 10^91\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4109 for each valid iii\nthe intervals are pairwise disjoint\nthe sum of NNN for all test cases does not exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x851053 \\cdot 10^53\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of MMM for all test cases does not exceed 3\xe2\x8b\x851053 \\cdot 10^53\xe2\x8b\x85105\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (30 points):\n\nthe sum of NNN for all test cases does not exceed 1,0001,0001,000\nthe sum of MMM for all test cases does not exceed 1,0001,0001,000\n\nSubtask #2 (70 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n4 5\n5 7\n9 10\n2 3\n20 30\n5\n6\n7\n35\n10\n0\n2\n-1\n1\nExplanation:\nQuery 111: The person coming at time 555 does not have to wait as the restaurant is open in [5,7)[5,7)[5,7) slot.\nQuery 222: The person coming at time 666 does not have to wait as the restaurant is open in [5,7)[5,7)[5,7) slot.\nQuery 333: The person coming at time 777 has to wait since the restaurant is closed at time 777.
