b'Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.\nProblem description\nRudreshwar likes random numbers and random arrays. Today Rudreshwar started playing with a couple of Arrays A and B, each of size N.\nInitially A is filled with zeros. Rudreshwar filled B with random numbers.\nRudreshwar visits each index i (1 <= i <= N) in random order. When at i, he selects another random index j such that j is greater or equal to i. He then increments A[i], A[i+1], A[i+2] ... A[j] by 1.\nFinally if for any index i, A[i] is greater than B[i], he then throws away that array A\nFor a given B, calculate the number of different arrays A, that Rudreshwar can end up with. Two arrays are called different if there exists an index where the arrays have different values\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. First line of each test case contains an integer N. Second line contains N space separated integers representing the array B\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the required answer modulo 1000000007.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 100\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 1000\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 B[i] \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n2\n2 2\n3\n1 1 12\n1\nExplanation:\nTest case 1\n{1, 1} and {1, 2} are valid.\nTest case 2\n{1, 1, 1} is the only possible final array A.'
