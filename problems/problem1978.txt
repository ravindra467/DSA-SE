b"Problem\nThe Stark Kingdom has NNN cities (numbered 1 to NNN) representing a connected undirected graph. There are MMM bidirectional roads connecting any two cities. ithithith city has AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b soldiers.\nThe Lannisters secretly sent an army to the Stark Kingdom to defeat them. When the Starks came to know of this, very little time was left and they had to gather a huge army.\nWarlords of XXX cities D1,D2,D3,\xe2\x80\xa6,DXD_1, D_2, D_3, \\dots ,D_XD1\xe2\x80\x8b,D2\xe2\x80\x8b,D3\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,DX\xe2\x80\x8b were given the task of gathering soldiers from RRR cities C1,C2,C3,\xe2\x80\xa6,CRC_1, C_2, C_3, \\dots ,C_RC1\xe2\x80\x8b,C2\xe2\x80\x8b,C3\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,CR\xe2\x80\x8b other than the chosen XXX ones. As time left was very less, they had to choose the nearest cities (i.e. the warlord can choose a city at distance i+1i + 1i+1 from it only if all the possible cities at distance iii from all the XXX warlords have already been chosen). A warlord can choose a city only if there is a path from that city to the warlord's city. The total number of soldiers \xe2\x88\x91Ay\\sum A_y\xe2\x88\x91Ay\xe2\x80\x8b gathered form all RRR cities should be maximum possible. Print the maximum number of soldiers that can be gathered.\nInput:\n\nFirst line has two space separated integers, NNN and MMM.\nNext line has NNN space separated integers AiA_iAi\xe2\x80\x8b denoting the number of soldiers in the ithithith city.\nNext MMM lines have two space separated integers bbb and ccc denoting that there exists a road between cities bbb and ccc.\nNext line has two space separated integers XXX, the number of chosen cities and RRR, the number of cities from which soldiers are to be recruited.\nNext line has XXX space separated integers DiD_iDi\xe2\x80\x8b \xe2\x80\x93 the cities whose warlords were chosen.\n\nOutput:\nFor each case print one integer \xe2\x80\x93 the maximum number of soldiers that can be gathered.\nConstraints\n\n2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xc3\x971052 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\times 10^52\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa42\xc3\x97105\nM\xe2\x89\xa4min(2\xc3\x97105,n(n\xe2\x88\x921)).M \\leq min (2 \\times 10^5, n(n - 1) ).M\xe2\x89\xa4min(2\xc3\x97105,n(n\xe2\x88\x921)).\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4104\n1\xe2\x89\xa4b,c\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq b, c \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4b,c\xe2\x89\xa4N\n0\xe2\x89\xa4X,R\xe2\x89\xa4N0 \\leq X, R \\leq N0\xe2\x89\xa4X,R\xe2\x89\xa4N\nX+R\xe2\x89\xa4NX + R \\leq NX+R\xe2\x89\xa4N\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Di\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq D_i \\leq N1\xe2\x89\xa4Di\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4N\n\nSample Input:\n11 12\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\n1 9\n2 9\n1 3\n2 3\n1 4\n4 3\n3 5\n3 6\n6 7\n7 8\n6 10\n10 11\n2 4\n3 6\n\nSample Output:\n30\n\nEXPLANATION:\n\nLet the warlord of city 3 choose 4 and 5 and of city 6 choose 7 and 10.\nThe cities are at minimum possible distance from the warlord\xe2\x80\x99s city that chose them.\nSo, the number of soldiers = A4+A5+A7A_4 + A_5 + A_7A4\xe2\x80\x8b+A5\xe2\x80\x8b+A7\xe2\x80\x8b + A10 = 30."
