b"Problem\nThe chef has received a problem from his friend who is a chemist.\r\nHe has got n candies.\r\nThis all candies have some sucrose level.\r\nHe has to eat such candy whose sucrose level is the difference of sucrose level of candy with maximum and minimum sucrose level.\nInput:\n\n\nFirst line will contain TTT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.\n\n\nEach testcase contains of two line of input.\n\n\nFirst-line contains an integer n, no of candies.\n\nSecond-line contains array A of sucrose level of all n candies.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, output in a single line answer printing sucrose level of candy that chef will eat Or printing  NO if the chef doesn't find the candy with appropriate sucrose level he needs.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq T \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa4101 \\leq n \\leq 101\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x89\xa410\n1\xe2\x89\xa4A[i]\xe2\x89\xa410001 \\leq A[i] \\leq 10001\xe2\x89\xa4A[i]\xe2\x89\xa41000\n0\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4(n\xe2\x88\x921)0 \\leq i \\leq (n-1)0\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4(n\xe2\x88\x921)\n\nSample Input:\n 2\r\n 5\r\n 2 1 3 4 5\r\n 3\r\n 3 2 2\n\nSample Output:\n 4\r\n NO\n\nEXPLANATION:\nFor 1st test case:\r\nThis array is :\r\n[2,1,3,4,5] .Here, maximum sucrose level is 5 and minimum sucrose level is 1.\r\nTheir difference gives a sucrose level 4 which is present in a given array.\nHence the answer is 4.\nFor 2nd test case:\r\nThis array is :\r\n[3,2,2] .Here, maximum sucrose level is 3 and the minimum sucrose level is 2.\r\nTheir difference gives a sucrose level 1.which is not present in a given array.so, he will not eat candy.so we will print no.\nHence the answer is NO."
