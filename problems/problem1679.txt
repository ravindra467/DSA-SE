b"Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese  and Russian.\nChef has N simple polygons (non self intersecting polygons) in which no two of them intersect with each other. For any two polygons P1, P2, either P1 lies inside P2 or vice versa. \nChef wants you to count number of polygons lying strictly inside each of the polygons.\nInput\nFirst line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. First line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of polygons.\nThe description of N polygons is as follows:\n\nThe first line contains an integer Mi denoting the number of vertices in the ith polygon\nThe second line contains Mi pairs of integers Xi, j, Yi, j representing coordinates of vertices of ith  polygon in clockwise or counterclockwise order\n\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing N space-separated integers such that ith of them represents number of polygons lying inside the ith polygon.\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n3 \xe2\x89\xa4 Mi \xe2\x89\xa4 105\nThe sum of Mi (or total amount of given points) over all test cases in one test file does not exceed 2*105\nAbsolute value of each coordinate doesn't exceed 109\n\n\nSubtask 1: (10 points)\n\nT \xe2\x89\xa4 6\n2 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 10\n3 \xe2\x89\xa4 Mi \xe2\x89\xa4 10\nAbsolute value of each coordinate doesn't exceed 30\n\n \nSubtask 2: (20 points)\n\nAll polygons are  convex polygons .\n\n \nSubtask 3: (70 points)\n\nOriginal constraints\n\n \nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n3\n6\n-2 2 -1 1 2 2 2 -1 1 -2 -2 -2\n3\n-1 -1 1 -1 1 1\n4\n3 3 -3 3 -3 -3 3 -31 0 2\nExplanation:\n\nIn the picture the first polygon is marked in green, second - in red and third in blue color.\n\n "
