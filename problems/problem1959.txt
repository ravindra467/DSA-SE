b'Problem\n Read problems statements in Mandarin Chinese and Russian as well.\nYou are given a tree.\nYou have to execute numerous queries on this tree. In a query, you will be given K nodes and you need to find if there is a path in the tree which contains all these K nodes.\nIf there is a path containing these K nodes, then output Yes. Otherwise, output No.\nInput\nFirst line contains T, number of test cases to follow.\nFirst line of each test case contains an integer N which represents the number of nodes in the tree.\nNext N-1 lines contain the description of the tree. Each line contains 2 space separated integers implying that there is an edge between these two nodes.\nNext line contains Q, number of path queries to follow.\nFirst line of each query contains an integer K.\nSecond line contains K space separated nodes.\nOutput\n\nFor each query, output Yes if there is a path containing the K query nodes. Otherwise, output No.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Sum of N over all test cases \xe2\x89\xa4 105\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 T \xe2\x89\xa4 500 \n3 \xe2\x89\xa4 K \xe2\x89\xa4 N\n1 \xe2\x89\xa4 Sum of K over all test cases and queries \xe2\x89\xa4 106\nNodes are numbered from 1\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n10\n3 1\n5 7\n4 6\n10 4\n8 9\n2 1\n3 4\n8 5\n5 3\n4\n3\n8 10 3\n4\n8 7 9 6\n3\n2 1 6\n3\n6 2 5Yes\nNo\nYes\nNo'
