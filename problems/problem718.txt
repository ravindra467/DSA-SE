In FFL, each team consists of exactly 151515 players: 222 goalkeepers, 555 defenders, 555 midfielders and 333 forwards. Chef has already bought 131313 players; he is only missing one defender and one forward.\nThere are NNN available players (numbered 111 through NNN). For each valid iii, the iii-th player is either a defender or a forward and has a price PiP_iPi\xe2\x80\x8b. The sum of prices of all players in a team must not exceed 100100100 dollars and the players Chef bought already cost him SSS dollars.\nCan you help Chef determine if he can complete the team by buying one defender and one forward in such a way that he does not exceed the total price limit?\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers NNN and SSS.\nThe second line contains NNN space-separated integers P1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PNP_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_NP1\xe2\x80\x8b,P2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,PN\xe2\x80\x8b.\nThe last line contains NNN space-separated integers. For each valid iii, the iii-th of these integers is 000 if the iii-th player is a defender or 111 if the iii-th player is a forward.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "yes" if it is possible to build a complete team or "no" otherwise (without quotes).\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le T \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le N \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n13\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa410013 \\le S \\le 10013\xe2\x89\xa4S\xe2\x89\xa4100\n1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le P_i \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4100 for each valid iii\n\nSubtasks\nSubtask #1 (100 points): original constraints\nSample 1:\nInputOutput2\n4 90\n3 8 6 5\n0 1 1 0\n4 90\n5 7 6 5\n0 1 1 0yes\nno\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: If Chef buys the 111-st and 333-rd player, the total price of his team is 90+9=9990 + 9 = 9990+9=99, which is perfectly fine. There is no other valid way to pick two players.\nExample case 2: Chef cannot buy two players in such a way that all conditions are satisfied.'
