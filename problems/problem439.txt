Find the expected value of P(A)P(A)P(A).\nFor each valid nnn, it can be proved that the expected value can be expressed as a fraction P/QP / QP/Q, where PPP and QQQ are positive integers and QQQ is coprime with 998,244,353998,244,353998,244,353. You should compute P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921P \\cdot Q^{-1}P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 998,244,353998,244,353998,244,353, where Q\xe2\x88\x921Q^{-1}Q\xe2\x88\x921 is the multiplicative inverse of QQQ modulo 998,244,353998,244,353998,244,353.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers NNN, KKK, LLL and RRR.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing NNN space-separated integers. For each valid iii, the iii-th of these integers should be P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921P \\cdot Q^{-1}P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921 modulo 998,244,353998,244,353998,244,353 for n=in = in=i.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4201 \\leq T \\leq 201\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa420\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x851051 \\leq N \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^51\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa45\xe2\x8b\x85105\n1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\leq L \\leq R \\leq K \\leq 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4106\nthe sum of NNN over all test cases does not exceed 5\xe2\x8b\x851055 \\cdot 10^55\xe2\x8b\x85105\nthe sum of KKK over all test cases does not exceed 10610^6106\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n2 2 1 21 748683266\nExplanation:\nExample case 1: For n=1n = 1n=1, we have P([1])=P([2])=1P([1]) = P([2]) = 1P([1])=P([2])=1 and P(A)=0P(A) = 0P(A)=0 for any other sequence. Hence, the expected value is 2/2=12 / 2 = 12/2=1.\nFor n=2n = 2n=2, there are four valid sequences [1,1][1,1][1,1], [1,2][1,2][1,2], [2,1][2,1][2,1] and [2,2][2,2][2,2]. Each of them can be split into one-element subsequences. In addition, [1,1][1,1][1,1] can be left unchanged (split into only one subsequence), so P([1,1])=2P([1,1]) = 2P([1,1])=2. The expected value is (2+1+1+1)/4=5/4=748,683,266(2+1+1+1) / 4 = 5/4 = 748,683,266(2+1+1+1)/4=5/4=748,683,266."
