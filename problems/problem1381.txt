b"Problem\nRead problems statements in Hindi, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, and Bengali as well.\nThis is an interactive problem.\nSushi has a sequence of integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b; each of them is between 111 and 10610^6106 inclusive. You do not know this sequence, but for a strange reason (maybe because you love her!), you have to find it.\nYou may ask up to 2,2222,2222,222 queries. In each query:\n\nYou should choose two integers KKK and XXX (1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N+11 \\le K \\le N + 11\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4N+1, 1\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\le X \\le 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4X\xe2\x89\xa4106).\nSushi creates a new sequence B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN+1B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_{N+1}B1\xe2\x80\x8b,B2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN+1\xe2\x80\x8b, where BK=XB_K = XBK\xe2\x80\x8b=X and if we deleted the element BKB_KBK\xe2\x80\x8b from this sequence, we would obtain the sequence AAA.\nThen, Sushi tells you the number of inversions in the sequence BBB, i.e. the number of pairs (i,j)(i, j)(i,j) such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4N+11 \\le i \\lt j \\le N + 11\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4N+1 and Bi>BjB_i \\gt B_jBi\xe2\x80\x8b>Bj\xe2\x80\x8b.\n\nInteraction\n\nFirst, you should read a line containing a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of interaction for TTT test cases follows.\nFor each test case, you should start by reading a line containing a single integer NNN.\nTo ask a query, you should print a line containing the character '?', followed by a space and two space-separated integers KKK and XXX describing your query. Then, you must read a line containing a single integer \xe2\x80\x95 the answer to the query.\nWhen you have guessed the sequence, print a single line containing the character '!', followed by a space and NNN space-separated integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_NA1\xe2\x80\x8b,A2\xe2\x80\x8b,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN\xe2\x80\x8b (1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\le A_i \\le 10^61\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x89\xa4106 for each valid iii). This does not count as a query.\n\nIf you ask more than 2,2222,2222,222 queries or do not follow the interaction format, you may receive any verdict.\nDo not forget to flush the output after printing each line!\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4201 \\le T \\le 201\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa420\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\le N \\le 1001\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4100\n\nExample Input\nYou             Sushi\r\n                2\r\n                2\r\n? 1 1\r\n                1\r\n? 2 4\r\n                2\r\n? 2 2\r\n                3\r\n? 3 4\r\n                1\r\n! 3 1\r\n                1\r\n? 1 5\r\n                1\r\n? 1 4\r\n                0\r\n! 4\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: The sequence Sushi has is A=[3,1]A = [3, 1]A=[3,1]. Your interaction with Sushi is as follows:\n\n? 1 1: Sushi creates the sequence B=[1,3,1]B = [1, 3, 1]B=[1,3,1] and returns the number of inversions in it, which is 111.\n? 2 4: Sushi creates the sequence B=[3,4,1]B = [3, 4, 1]B=[3,4,1] and returns the number of inversions in it, which is 222.\n? 2 2: Sushi creates the sequence B=[3,2,1]B = [3, 2, 1]B=[3,2,1] and returns the number of inversions in it, which is 333.\n? 3 4: Sushi creates the sequence B=[3,1,4]B = [3, 1, 4]B=[3,1,4] and returns the number of inversions in it, which is 111.\n! 3 1: You have guessed the sequence to be [3,1][3, 1][3,1], which is correct.\n"
