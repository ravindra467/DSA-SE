This novel game is played with NNN stacks, each of them containing only 111-s and 000-s.\nJust like in normal Nim, Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum alternate turns; in their turn, a player must choose one non-empty stack and remove a positive number of elements from the top of this stack. However, Tweedle-Dee may only choose a stack with 000 at the top (and remove elements from it afterwards), and similarly, Tweedle-Dum may only choose a stack with 111 at the top. The player that cannot make a move for the first time wins.\nAda does not want to wait for the end of the game, so she asked you to determine the winner of the game if you are given the starting player. Remember that Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum are legendary grandmasters of combinatorial games, so they both always play optimally.\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer TTT denoting the number of test cases. The description of TTT test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer NNN, followed by a space and a string SSS denoting the player that starts the game.\nEach of the following NNN lines contains a single binary string BBB representing a stack; the first character of BBB corresponds to the top element of the stack and the last character to the bottom element.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string "Dee" if Tweedle-Dee wins the match or "Dum" if Tweedle-Dum wins.\nConstraints\n\n1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa45001 \\le T \\le 5001\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa4500\n1\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa4501 \\le N \\le 501\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa450\n1\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3B\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa4501 \\le |B| \\le 501\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x88\xa3B\xe2\x88\xa3\xe2\x89\xa450\neach character in BBB is either \'1\' or \'0\'\nSSS is either "Dee" or "Dum"\n\nSample 1:\nInputOutput1\n2 Dee\n010\n101Dee'
